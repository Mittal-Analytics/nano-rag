**INDIAN ECONOMY**

India has been witnessing robust economic growth due to 
resilient domestic demand and proactive policy measures 
implemented by the Government. The Indian economy is 
estimated to grow at 7.6% in FY 2023-24, surpassing the 
7% growth rate recorded in FY 2022-23. Accordingly, the 
construction sector is estimated to post double-digit growth 
rate of 10.7%. This is followed closely by the manufacturing 
sector, which is estimated to record a solid growth rate of 
8.5%. The global rating agency Moody's anticipates that 
the Indian economy will continue to outpace other G-20 
economies, driven by policy continuity following the general 
election.
