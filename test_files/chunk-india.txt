**GLOBAL ECONOMY**

The global economy underwent a modest recovery to grow 
at an estimated 3.2%, in CY 2023. This can be attributed 
to a robust increase in consumer demand, accumulation 
of savings during pandemic restrictions, and abundant job 
opportunities in labour markets. However, there were also 
challenges such as geopolitical tensions and ongoing supply 
chain disruptions. The decision by central banks around the 
world to raise interest rates to combat inflation also posed 
challenges to economic growth.

Advanced economies such as the United States (US) 
experienced a more modest growth rate of 2.5% in CY 2023. 
This can be attributed to strong consumer spending and a 
robust job market. However, the Eurozone faced a tougher 
climb with growth recorded at 0.4% in CY 2023. High energy

prices and a less confident consumer base were significant 
factors influencing this slower growth. In contrast, emerging 
and developing economies fared better, collectively 
experiencing a more rapid expansion at 4.3% in CY 2023. 
This growth was strengthened by China's reopening of the 
economy after stringent pandemic restrictions and India's 
robust domestic demand.

However, despite overall growth, inflation remained a 
significant global concern. While headline inflation figures 
began to cool towards the end of the year, they remained 
above central bank targets in most countries. Consequently, 
major central banks such as the Federal Reserve and the 
European Central Bank maintained a hawkish stance, 
repeatedly raising interest rates and tightening financial 
conditions in response.

**OUTLOOK**

In CY 2024 and 2025, the global economy is walking 
on a tightrope, having shown resilience by avoiding 
pessimistic recession projections and maintaining stable 
growth. Growth is projected at a modest 3.2% for both 
years, despite challenges from stricter monetary policies, 
reduced government spending, and slow productivity gains. 
Inflation is expected to cool to 5.9% in CY 2024 and 4.5% in  
CY 2025, but policymakers must carefully manage its decline 
to avoid hindering growth. Faster disinflation and China's 
recovery offer promising opportunities, while geopolitical 
tensions and persistent inflation pose downside risks. Long-
term growth, especially in emerging markets, relies heavily 
on structural reforms aimed at boosting productivity and 
ensuring sustainable debt levels.

**INDIAN ECONOMY**

India has been witnessing robust economic growth due to 
resilient domestic demand and proactive policy measures 
implemented by the Government. The Indian economy is 
estimated to grow at 7.6% in FY 2023-24, surpassing the 
7% growth rate recorded in FY 2022-23. Accordingly, the 
construction sector is estimated to post double-digit growth 
rate of 10.7%. This is followed closely by the manufacturing 
sector, which is estimated to record a solid growth rate of 
8.5%. The global rating agency Moody's anticipates that 
the Indian economy will continue to outpace other G-20 
economies, driven by policy continuity following the general 
election.
