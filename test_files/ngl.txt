**MD’S MESSAGE**

**I am delighted to present our 
Annual Report for FY 2023-
24, which encapsulates the 
performance and strategic 
initiatives amid a challenging 
global environment. Despite 
prevailing headwinds, NGL 
Fine-Chem has not only 
stayed on course with the 
strategic plans, but has also 
delivered a commendable 
performance across various 
fronts, even in a tough 
environment.**

**10**

ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24

----

**How do you look back at FY 2023-24?**

During FY 2023-24, we successfully enhanced 
our market share and expanded our presence 
in the Animal Healthcare API market, driven by 
the increasing demand for veterinary drugs. This 
growth was fuelled by factors such as the rising 
prevalence of zoonotic diseases, expanding animal 
populations, and the humanisation of pets, which led 
to heightened expenditure on animal healthcare.

While the global economy faced significant 
challenges, including geopolitical tensions and 
inflationary pressures, the Indian economy 
demonstrated resilience with robust investment 
activity and strong private consumption. Despite 
these supportive domestic conditions, we 
encountered several significant challenges, 
including subdued demand, high customer inventory 
levels, and currency volatility in key markets such 
as Egypt, Pakistan, and Turkey. Initially, these 
factors constrained our performance and created a 
competitive landscape marked by pricing pressures. 
However, as the year progressed, these challenges 
gradually eased. The inventory destocking phase, 
which had been a significant headwind, came to 
an end, leading to a notable recovery in demand, 
particularly from the Asia region. This recovery was 
driven by robust volume growth even as average 
realisations remained stable.

What is your view on the outlook for 
the animal healthcare industry? 

The outlook for the animal healthcare industry is 
promising, driven by increasing awareness and 
expenditure on animal health. We are witnessing a 
growing demand for animal healthcare products, 

and the industry is poised for significant growth. 
Our strategic positioning allows us to capitalise on 
these trends by expanding our product offerings and 
reaching new territories.

Despite significant headwinds earlier in FY 2023-24, 
such as subdued demand, high customer inventory 
levels, and currency volatility in key markets, we 
observed a recovery in demand in the latter part 
of the year, particularly from the Asia region. 
Additionally, a significant reduction in raw material 
costs helped us return to normalised margin levels, 
contributing to an overall improvement in our 
financial performance. Our focus on maintaining a 
diversified product portfolio and avoiding excessive 
reliance on any single product, customer, or 
geography has been a cornerstone of our resilience.

**How would you mark the Company’s 
performance amid the slower demand 
scenario in H1 FY 2023-24?**

Despite macroeconomic challenges, our financial 
performance has demonstrated resilience. In  
FY 2023-24, our total revenues surged to  
` 328.97 Crores. Notably, our EBITDA reached  
` 58.85 Crores, reflecting a 58.62% increase from 
the previous year. Our Profit after Tax (PAT) doubled 
compared to FY 2022-23, reaching ` 34.50 Crores. 
Our ongoing focus on optimising both operations 
and financial outcomes has enabled us to adeptly 
respond to market fluctuations, ensuring sustained 
growth in the years ahead. The gross margin for  
FY 2023-24 was approximately 53.2%, compared to 
52.2% in FY 2022-23, reflecting improved operational 
efficiencies and economies of scale.

**Dear Shareholders,**

**Embodying our annual report’s theme for the year ‘Grow. Expand. Thrive.’, at NGL 
Fine-Chem, we have pursued ambitious strategies to cement our leadership in the 
veterinary API market. This year, we continued focussing on driving growth through 
capacity expansions, product diversification, and strategic entries into high-growth 
segments. By strengthening our core business and achieving self-reliance across the 
value chain, we are poised to secure profitability and industry leadership.**

I am delighted to present our Annual Report for FY 2023-24, which encapsulates the performance and strategic 
initiatives amid a challenging global environment. Despite prevailing headwinds, NGL Fine-Chem has not only stayed 
on course with the strategic plans, but has also delivered a commendable performance across various fronts, even in 
a tough environment.

**What operational updates would you 
like to highlight?**

Our commitment to providing value-driven solutions 
to our clients has been a key factor in our success. 
By prioritising the consistent delivery of high-quality 
products, we have expanded our collaborations 
and strengthened our market presence. A 
significant aspect of our operations is our focus 
on R&D, particularly in complex multi-step organic 
synthesis for the manufacture of generic APIs and 
intermediates. This has enabled us to maintain a 
diversified product portfolio, avoiding excessive 
reliance on any single product, customer, or 
geography, which has been the cornerstone of our 
resilience.

We are significantly enhancing our production 
capacities by commissioning new plants and 
pharmaceutical-grade clean rooms. This vertically 
integrated approach, combined with the global shift 
to the China+1 supply strategy, is likely to help shift 
the base to India, benefiting players like us in the 
animal healthcare industry. Ongoing construction 
at our Tarapur facility is pivotal in expanding our 
manufacturing capabilities. This increase in capacity, 
along with our innovative product portfolio, positions 
us well to meet the rising demand for animal 
healthcare products.

If the demand recovery continues positively, we may 
explore outsourcing some fine manufacturing to 
capitalise on growth opportunities. The recovery we 
have seen is encouraging, and if it remains strong, we 
may outsource manufacturing until our new facility 
becomes operational. Our CAPEX plan is progressing 
well and remains on track, with the first phase 
expected to be completed by the end of FY 2024-25. 
Our focus will be on gaining market share and growing 
our business while maintaining financial prudence 
and sustainability.

**How is the Company handling the 
regulatory challenges in international 
markets?**

Navigating regulatory challenges, particularly in 
markets like the US and Europe, is a critical focus 
for us due to the varied regulations across regions. 
In the US, the process involves preparing the plant, 
producing validation batches, filing necessary 
documentation, and undergoing an inspection, which 
typically takes 2-3 years. The European market, 
however, allows for a more expedited process. 
Through strategic planning and execution, we ensure 
compliance with all regulatory requirements, thereby 
facilitating our entry and growth in these vital 
markets.

**How does the Company envision 
sustainability?**

At NGL, our commitment to adapting to the evolving 
landscape of the industry drives our pursuit of 
long-term, sustainable growth. Transitioning our 
manufacturing plants to eco-friendly fuels marks 
a significant milestone in this journey. We have 
phased out liquid fuels like furnace oil and solid fuels 
such as coal, embracing sustainable alternatives 
like Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) and biomass 
briquettes derived from agricultural waste. This 
strategic shift ensures that our operations solely 
rely on clean fuels, significantly reducing our 
environmental footprint. Our proactive measures 
champion a sustainable future, fostering a culture 
where prosperity is mutual among the Company, its 
employees, communities, and the environment.

**Can you elaborate on the Company’s 
approach to Corporate Social 
Responsibility (CSR) and community 
impact?**

At NGL Fine-Chem, we embrace Corporate Social 
Responsibility (CSR) initiatives with the aim to 
create a positive societal impact. We are committed 
to investing in our communities and fostering 
sustainable growth. Our CSR efforts are focussed 
on various aspects including environmental 

sustainability, education, and healthcare. 
Additionally, investing in a highly skilled workforce 
and fostering a culture of innovation within our 
organisation ensures that we not only deliver 
superior products but also contribute to the well-
being and development of our society.

I would like to sign off by extending my most 
sincere appreciation to our esteemed stakeholders, 
distinguished Board members, diligent team, and 
our valued clientele. Your persistent trust and 
enduring support constitute the cornerstone of our 
success. As we embark upon another promising 
year, I am confident that together, we will continue 
to create a significant impact, playing a pivotal role 
in advancing prosperity. With your ongoing support, 
we will leverage our strengths, pursue sustainable 
growth, reach significant milestones, and continue to 
accelerate our momentum.

Warm Regards,

**24.	 OVERVIEW OF THE ENTITY’S MATERIAL RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS CONDUCT ISSUES**

	
Please indicate material responsible business conduct and sustainability issues pertaining to environmental and social 
matters that present a risk or an opportunity to your business, rationale for identifying the same, approach to adapt or 
mitigate the risk along-with its financial implications, as per the following format

**S. 
No.
Material issue 
identified
Indicate 
whether 
risk or 
opportunity 
(R/O)**

**Rationale for identifying 
the risk/opportunity
In case of risk, approach to 
adapt or mitigate
Financial implications of 
the risk or opportunity 
(Indicate positive or 
negative implications)**

1.

ESG 
compliance

Risk
Risk: ESG compliance 
risk is associated with 
non-adherence to the 
standards and guidelines 
set forth by all local 
and global regulatory 
agencies, focussing 
on pharmacovigilance, 
proprietary, confidentiality 
and other core governance 
standards (For instance, 
CGMP and CGLP, among 
others)

1.    Focussing on stable and 
larger markets.

2.    Strengthening regulatory 
capacity in key markets 
by actively engaging with 
regulatory agencies and 
hence mitigating risks 
from external sources.

Positive: Compliance 
with relevant regulatory 
requirements pertaining to 
the ESG domain reflects the 
Company’s commitment 
towards responsible 
business practices.

Negative: Non-compliance 
with ESG and regulatory 
requirements may affect 
the Company’s image 
and impact its business 
continuity in the long term.

3.

Managing 
waste

Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: Waste, water and 
energy management 
have been identified 
as key material issues 
under the climate change 
and environmental risk. 
This risk is addressed 
to emphasise on the 
Company’s climate 
consciousness and its 
contribution towards 
mitigation action plans 
against climate change.

Opportunity: 
Comprehensive resource 
management plans aligned 
with NGL’s environment 
conservation strategy will 
highlight the Company’s 
commitment towards 
improving environmental 
preservation and its 
contribution towards 
climate change mitigation 
action plans

1.    Ensuring compliance 
through robust 
governance and 
review mechanisms, 
strengthening 
capabilities of the EHS 
and legal compliance 
teams, conducting 
risk assessments 
and periodic reviews, 
and implementing 
compliance management 
software to track and 
monitor adherence to 
all relevant regulatory 
requirements.

2.    Undertaking proactive 
initiatives to mitigate 
the physical and 
transitional risks linked 
to climate change, 
such as, decarbonising 
operations, GHG 
emission reduction 
measures, and physical 
climate risk assessment 
to safeguard assets from 
the effects of climate 
change.

3.    The Company adheres 
to the precautionary 
principle (as outlined 
in the Rio Declaration 
1992) through the ERM 
framework to mitigate 
environmental risks.

Positive: The Company’s 
focus on strengthening 
climate and ESG-specific 
initiatives bolsters long-
term value-creation and 
enables the Company to 
effectively respond to rising 
stakeholder demands.

Negative: The lack of 
robust initiatives and action 
plans to contribute to ESG 
awareness and climate 
change could adversely 
impact the Company’s 
operations and lead to work 
force disruption.

4.

Occupational 
health and 
safety

Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: Occupational health 
and safety is a critical 
aspect of the Company’s 
commitment to workforce 
welfare, emphasising the 
importance of providing a 
safe and secure working 
environment. Identification 
of a high number of health 
and safety incidents 
reflects the effectiveness 
of the existing EHS 
management approach.

1.    Implementing a robust 
EHS management 
system with periodic 
internal and external 
audits of safety 
practices.

2.    Adopting comprehensive 
corrective action 
plans following the 
identification and 
assessment of safety 
incidents to prevent 
future instances.

Positive: A robust 
occupational health and 
safety management 
approach enables the 
Company to prevent the 
occurrence of incidents.

Negative: Frequent safety 
incidents and injuries 
may adversely impact the 
Company’s performance, 
both in terms of safety and 
workforce well-being.

**Rationale for identifying

(Indicate positive or 
negative implications)**

Opportunity: A strong 
EHS management 
system integrated with  
comprehensive hazard 
identification, mitigation 
plans, root cause analysis 
of the reported incidents 
and corresponding 
corrective action plans, will 
highlight NGL’s approach 
and dedication to ensuring 
workforce health and 
safety.

5.

Climate change

Risk
Extreme weather events 
linked to climate change 
can disrupt supply chains 
and manufacturing 
operations, thereby 
affecting the production 
and distribution of NGL’s 
products. For example, 
events such as heat 
waves or excessive rainfall 
in the areas where the 
Company’s manufacturing 
facilities and offices 
are located can lead to 
increased absenteeism, 
thereby impacting the 
overall efficiency of the 
Company.

NGL conducts mandatory 
safety training and 
awareness sessions across 
its operations, including 
manufacturing sites and 
offices. These sessions 
cover emergency evacuation 
procedures, especially 
important during natural 
disasters.

Negative: Since this is a 
systemic risk, the Company 
cannot fully control the 
same, and instead,  strives 
to mitigate it to a certain 
extent. 

6.

Talent 
development

Opportunity Investing in talent 
development gives the 
Company a strategic 
edge, promoting individual 
growth that enhances 
organisational agility and 
competitiveness.

Prioritising employee 
growth nurtures a 
culture of continuous 
improvement and positions 
companies as preferred 
employers, attracting top 
talent and ensuring long-
term success.

Business ethics

Risk
Failing to uphold business 
ethics can expose a 
company to significant 
risks. Engaging in unethical 
behaviour can harm the 
Company’s reputation and 
erode public trust, resulting 
in the loss of customers, 
investors, and other 
stakeholders.

The Company adheres 
strictly to its Code of 
Conduct, which serves as a 
comprehensive guide for all 
employees on values, ethics, 
and business principles.

The Company’s Whistle 
Blower Policy provides 
a mechanism for the 
employees to report any 
unethical or improper activity 
concerning the Company to 
the Chairman of the Board 
Audit Committee.

**MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS**

**GLOBAL ECONOMY**

The global economy underwent a modest recovery to grow 
at an estimated 3.2%, in CY 2023. This can be attributed 
to a robust increase in consumer demand, accumulation 
of savings during pandemic restrictions, and abundant job 
opportunities in labour markets. However, there were also 
challenges such as geopolitical tensions and ongoing supply 
chain disruptions. The decision by central banks around the 
world to raise interest rates to combat inflation also posed 
challenges to economic growth.

Advanced economies such as the United States (US) 
experienced a more modest growth rate of 2.5% in CY 2023. 
This can be attributed to strong consumer spending and a 
robust job market. However, the Eurozone faced a tougher 
climb with growth recorded at 0.4% in CY 2023. High energy 

prices and a less confident consumer base were significant 
factors influencing this slower growth. In contrast, emerging 
and developing economies fared better, collectively 
experiencing a more rapid expansion at 4.3% in CY 2023. 
This growth was strengthened by China's reopening of the 
economy after stringent pandemic restrictions and India's 
robust domestic demand.

However, despite overall growth, inflation remained a 
significant global concern. While headline inflation figures 
began to cool towards the end of the year, they remained 
above central bank targets in most countries. Consequently, 
major central banks such as the Federal Reserve and the 
European Central Bank maintained a hawkish stance, 
repeatedly raising interest rates and tightening financial 
conditions in response.

**OUTLOOK**

In CY 2024 and 2025, the global economy is walking 
on a tightrope, having shown resilience by avoiding 
pessimistic recession projections and maintaining stable

practice (GMP) regulations. Such scrutiny can result in 
substantial delays or even rejection of product approvals, 
further complicating market entry.

**Counterfeit Products**

The prevalence of counterfeit and substandard animal 
health products is a multifaceted challenge within the 
industry. These fraudulent products, often sold as legitimate 
medications, pose serious risks to both animals and 
consumers.

Firstly, counterfeit products compromise the efficacy of 
treatments. Animals may not receive the necessary dosage 
or active ingredients required for effective therapy, leading to 
inadequate treatment outcomes. This not only prolongs the 
suffering of the affected animals but also contributes to the 
spread of diseases and infections.

Moreover, the presence of counterfeit products undermines 
consumer trust and confidence in legitimate veterinary 
medications. When consumers unknowingly purchase 
fraudulent products that fail to deliver the expected results, 
they may become disillusioned with the entire market. This 
erosion of trust not only harms reputable manufacturers 
and suppliers but also creates confusion and scepticism 
among consumers, making them hesitant to seek veterinary 
care. Furthermore, counterfeit animal health products pose 
significant risks to market growth. As consumer confidence 
wanes and concerns about product authenticity grow, the 
demand for legitimate veterinary medications may decrease. 
This can stifle innovation and investment within the industry, 
hindering its overall growth and development.

base comprising approximately 400 clients, 
with no single customer contributing more 
than 6% to total revenue. This effectively 
mitigates 
the 
impact 
of 
customer 
concentration risk.
Product Quality Risk
This risk stems from the potential decline in 
product quality, which may result in the erosion 
of customer trust and revenue loss.

•	
The Company maintains a rigorous quality 
control system to uphold the high quality 
of products.

•	
Over the past decade, the Company has 
not encountered any product faults, even 
though it relies on contract manufacturers 
for 15% of total output.
Raw Material Supply Risk
This risk arises from reliance on a single or 
limited number of suppliers for raw materials, 
potentially resulting in supply disruptions that 
could impact production.

•	
The Company seeks to diversify supply 
base by looking for additional suppliers. 
China supplies approximately 25% of the 
Company’s total raw materials.
Product Concentration 
Risk
This risk stems from the reliance on a single 
or limited number of products for a substantial 
portion of the Company’s revenue.

•	
The Company intends to introduce two 
to four new product lines annually in the 
animal health sector. This initiative aims to 
diversify the product portfolio and diminish 
reliance on veterinary APIs, which currently 
constitute over 80% of the Company’s total 
income.
Climate Risk
This risk pertains to the potential adverse 
effects on the Company’s business operations, 
assets, and financial health resulting from 
climate change-related events. These events 
may include natural disasters, shifts in weather 
patterns, and regulatory measures targeting the 
reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.

•	
The Company conducts regular climate 
risk assessments to identify potential 
risks and opportunities associated with 
climate change, implementing appropriate 
measures to mitigate these risks.

•	
NGL has set a target to reduce its carbon 
footprint by 30% by 2030, accompanied 
by measures to monitor and report on its 
progress towards achieving this objective.

**Key Audit Matters**

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the 
standalone financial statements of the current period. 
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit 
of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and 
in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a 
separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the

**Revenue Recognition**

Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised 
goods to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration 
which the Company expects to receive in exchange for those 
goods. Revenue is measured based on transaction price, 
which is the consideration, adjusted for rebates, discounts and 
incentives as also estimated sales returns.

The Company has worked out the overhead absorption cost 
rate based on the consumption of electricity of each process 
and apply the same for all other overheads.

Due to significance of arriving at the overhead absorption rate 
for the valuation of inventories, it is considered to be a key 
audit matter.

**Statements and Auditor’s Report Thereon**

The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the 
preparation of the other information. The other information 
comprises the information included in the Management 
Discussion and Analysis, Board’s Report including Annexures 
to Board’s Report, Business Responsibility Report, Corporate 
Governance and Shareholder’s Information, but does 
not include the standalone financial statements and our 
auditor’s report thereon.

Our opinion on the standalone financial statements does not 
cover the other information and we do not express any form 
of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the standalone financial 
statements, our responsibility is to read the other information 
and, in doing so, consider whether the other information 
is materially inconsistent with the standalone financial 
statements or our knowledge obtained during the course of 
our audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that 
there is a material misstatement of this other information, 

we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report 
in this regard.

**Management’s Responsibility for the Standalone Financial 
Statements**

The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the 
matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Companies Act, 2013 
(“the Act”) with respect to preparation of these standalone 
financial statements that give a true and fair view of the 
financial position, financial performance including other 
comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in equity 
of the Company in accordance with the Indian Accounting 
Standards (Ind AS) prescribed under Section 133 of the 
Act, read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standard) 
Rules, 2015 as amended, and other accounting principles 
generally accepted in India.

This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate 
accounting records in accordance with the provisions of 
the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Company and 
for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; 
selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; 
making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and

prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of 
adequate internal financial controls, that were operating 
effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness 
of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and 
presentation of the financial statements that give a true and 
fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error.

In 
preparing 
the 
standalone 
financial 
statements, 

management is responsible for assessing the Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as 
applicable, matters related to going concern and using the 
going concern basis of accounting unless management 
either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease 
operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

The Board of Directors are responsible for overseeing the 
Company’s financial reporting process.

**Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone 
Financial Statements**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the standalone financial statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our 
opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, 
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance 
with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it 
exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they 
could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone 
financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:

•	
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement 
of the standalone financial statements, whether due 
to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures 
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence 
that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material 
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for 
one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, 
forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or 
the override of internal control.

•	
Obtain an understanding of internal financial controls 
relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures 
that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under 
section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for 
expressing our opinion on whether the Company has 
adequate internal financial controls system in place 
and the operating effectiveness of such controls.

•	
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies 
used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates 
and related disclosures made by management.

•	
Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use 
of the going concern basis of accounting and, based 
on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material 
uncertainty exists related to events or conditions 
that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude 
that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to 
draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related 
disclosures in the standalone financial statements or, if 
such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. 
Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence 
obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, 
future events or conditions may cause the Company to 
cease to continue as a going concern.

•	
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content 
of the standalone financial statements, including the 
disclosures, and whether the standalone financial 
statements represent the underlying transactions and 
events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the 
standalone financial statements that, individually or in 
aggregate, makes it probable that the economic decisions of 
a reasonably knowledgeable user of the financial statements 
may be influenced. We consider quantitative materiality and 
qualitative factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work 
and in evaluating the results of our work; and (ii) to evaluate 
the effect of any identified misstatements in the financial 
statements.

We communicate with those charged with governance 
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and 
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including 
any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify 
during our audit.

We also provide those charged with governance with a 
statement that we have complied with relevant ethical 
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate 
with them all relationships and other matters that may 
reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and 
where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of 
most significance in the audit of the standalone financial 
statements of the current period and are therefore the key 
audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s 
report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure 
about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, 
we determine that a matter should not be communicated 
in our report because the adverse consequences of doing

interest benefits of such communication.

Report on the Internal Financial Controls under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”)

**ANNEXURE - A 
TO THE AUDITOR’S REPORT**

We have audited the internal financial controls over financial 
reporting of M/S. NGL FINE-CHEM LIMITED (“the Company”) 
as of 31st March, 2024 in conjunction with our audit of the 
standalone financial statements of the Company for the year 
ended on that date.

**MANAGEMENT’S 
RESPONSIBILITY 
FOR 
INTERNAL**

**FINANCIAL CONTROLS**

The Company’s management is responsible for establishing 
and maintaining internal financial controls based on the 
internal control over financial reporting criteria established 
by the Company considering the essential components 
of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of 
Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting issued 
by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (‘ICAI’). 
These responsibilities include the design, implementation 
and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls 
that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly 
and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence 
to company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the 
prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy 
and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely 
preparation of reliable financial information, as required 
under the Companies Act, 2013.

**AUDITORS’ RESPONSIBILITY**

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s 
internal financial controls over financial reporting based on 
our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the 
Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls over 
Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) and the Standards 
on Auditing, issued by ICAI and deemed to be prescribed 
under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013, to the 
extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls, 
both applicable to an audit of Internal Financial Controls 
and, both issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of 
India. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that 
we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform 
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
adequate internal financial controls over financial reporting 
was established and maintained and if such controls 
operated effectively in all material respects.

Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit 
evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial 
controls system over financial reporting and their operating 
effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls over 
financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of 

internal financial controls over financial reporting, assessing 
the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and 
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal 
control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected 
depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment 
of the risks of material misstatement of the financial 
statements, whether due to fraud or error.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit 
opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls system 
over financial reporting.

**MEANING OF INTERNAL FINANCIAL CONTROLS OVER 
FINANCIAL REPORTING**

A company’s internal financial control over financial reporting 
is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance 
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the 
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
A company’s internal financial control over financial 
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) 
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable 
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and 
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide 
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as 
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, 
and that receipts and expenditures of the company are 
being made only in accordance with authorizations of 
management and directors of the company; and (3) provide 
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely 
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of 
the company’s assets that could have a material effect on 
the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial 
controls over financial reporting, including the possibility 
of collusion or improper management override of controls, 
material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and 
not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the 
internal financial controls over financial reporting to future 
periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial 
control over financial reporting may become inadequate 
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of 
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

**Opinion:-**

In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, an 
adequate internal financial controls system over financial 
reporting and such internal financial controls over financial 
reporting were operating effectively as at 31 March, 2024, 
based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria 
established by the Company considering the essential 
components of internal control stated in the Guidance 

Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial 
Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants 
of India.

**ANNEXURE - A 
TO THE AUDITOR’S REPORT (Contd.)**

----

The Annexure referred to in Independent Auditors’ Report to 

the members of the Company on the standalone financial 

statements for the year ended 31 March 2024, we report 

that:

(i)	
(a)	 (A)	 The 
Company 
has 
maintained 
proper 

records showing full particulars, including 

quantitative details and situation of property, 

plant and equipment and relevant details of 

right-of-use assets.

	
	
(B)	 The Company has maintained proper records 

showing full particulars of intangible assets.

	
(b)	 The Company has a regular programme of physical 

verification of its property, plant and equipment by 

which property, plant and equipment are verified in 

a phased manner over three years. In accordance 

with this programme, certain property, plant and 

equipment were verified during the year and the 

material discrepancies which were noticed have 

been properly dealt with in the books of account. In 

our opinion, this periodicity of physical verification 

is reasonable having regard to the size of the 

Company and the nature of its assets.

	
(c)	
According to the information and explanations 

given to us and on the basis of our examination 

of the records of the Company, the title deeds of 

immovable properties are held in the name of the 

Company.

	
(d)	 The company has not revalued its property, plant 

and equipment (including right of use assets) and 

intangible assets during the year.

	
(e) 	 In our opinion and according to the information 

and explanations given to us, no proceedings has 

been initiated or are pending against the company 

for holding any benami property under the Benami 

Transactions (Prohibition) Act, 1988 (45 of 1988) 

and rules made thereunder and therefore provision 

of clause 3(i)(e) of the order are not applicable to 

the company.

(ii)	
(a)	 The inventories have been physically verified by 

the management at reasonable intervals during 

the year.

	
	
In our opinion, this periodicity of physical 

verification is reasonable having regard to the size 

of the Company and the nature of its assets

	
(b)	 The company has availed working capital limits in 

excess of five crore rupees during the financial year, 

**ANNEXURE - B 
TO THE AUDITOR’S REPORT**

in aggregate, from banks or financial institutions 

on the basis of security of current assets. The 

management has been regular in furnishing 

returns/statements of book debts and inventories 

which are primary securities for the purpose of 

the working capital loans. In our opinion, based on 

the representation made by the management in 

note no 52 to the standalone financial statements 

and based upon our verification of the quarterly 

returns/ statements of inventories and trade 

receivables with the books of accounts, we have 

observed that, the data submitted to the bank 

vary with the books of accounts by 1 to 3%, due 

to the complexities involved in the valuation 

procedure. However, the management has made 

revised submissions at the end of each quarter 

and thereon the data submitted to the banks are 

in agreement with books of accounts.

(iii) 	 According to the information and explanations given 

to us and on the basis of our examination of the 

records of the Company, the Company has not made 

any investments, provided guarantee or security or 

granted any advances in the nature of loans, secured 

or unsecured, to companies, firms, limited liability 

partnerships or any other parties during the year and 

therefore provisions of clause 3 (iii)(a)(A)(B)(b)(c)(d)(e)

(f) of the order are not applicable.

(iv) 	 In our opinion and according to the information and 

explanations given to us, the Company has complied 

with the provisions of section 185 and 186 of the Act, 

with 	respect to the loans and investments made, as 

applicable.

(v)	
The Company has not accepted any deposits from the 

public and consequently the directives issued by the 

Reserve Bank of India, the provisions of sections 73 to 

76 or any other relevant provisions of the Companies 

Act, and the Rules framed there under are not applicable 

and also no orders were passed by Company Law 

Board, National Company Law Tribunal or Reserve 

Bank of India or any court or any other Tribunal and 

therefore clause 3(v) of the order is not applicable.

(vi)	 We have broadly reviewed the cost records maintained 

by the Company pursuant to the Companies (Cost 

Records and audit) Rules, 2014 for the maintenance of 

cost records under Section 148 (1) of the Act in respect 

of the Company’s products and are of the opinion

----

NOTES FORMING PART OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31ST MARCH, 2024 (Contd.)

**1.
CORPORATE INFORMATION**

	
NGL Fine-Chem Limited (The Company) is a public 
company 
domiciled 
in 
India 
and 
incorporated 

under the provisions of the Companies Act, 1956 
(CIN: L24110MH1981PLC025884). Its shares are 
listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange and National 
Stock Exchange. The Company is a manufacturer 
of pharmaceuticals and intermediates for usage in 
veterinary and human health. The Company caters to 
various global companies to custom manufacture high 
quality pharmaceuticals.

**2.
Basis of preparation**

	
Standalone financial statements for the year ended 31st 
March, 2024 are prepared in accordance with Indian 
Accounting Standards notified under the Companies 
(Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 together 
with comparative period data as at and for the year 
ended 31st March, 2023.

	
The financial statements have been prepared on accrual 
basis and under the historical cost convention except 
for certain financial instruments which are measured 
at fair value. Historical cost is generally based on the 
fair value of consideration given in exchange of goods 
and services. The accounting policies are consistently 
applied by the Company during the period and are 
consistent with those used in the previous year except 
where a newly issued accounting standard is initially 
adopted or a revision to an existing accounting standard 
requires a change in the accounting policy hitherto in 
use.

	
The financial statements are prepared in accordance 
with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS 34) as 
prescribed by Section 133 of the Companies Act 2013 
(“the Act”) read with the Companies (Indian Accounting 
Standards) Rules, 2015 and guidelines issued by the 
Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). These 
financial statements do not include all the information 
required for a complete set of financial statements 
under the applicable financial reporting framework. 
The financial statements are presented in Indian ` Lakh 
(functional currency of the Company) unless otherwise 
stated.

**3.
MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES**

**3.01	Use of estimates**

	
The preparation of standalone financial statements 
in conformity with Ind AS requires management 
to make judgments, estimates and assumptions 
that affect the application of accounting policies 
and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, the 
disclosures of contingent assets and contingent 

liabilities at the date of financial statements, and the 
income and expenses during the reporting period. 
The application of accounting policies that require 
critical accounting estimates involving complex and 
subjective judgements and use of assumptions in these 
standalone financial statements have been disclosed 
appropriately. Accounting estimates could change 
from period to period. Actual results may differ from 
these estimates. Appropriate changes in estimates 
are made as the management becomes aware of 
changes in circumstances surrounding the estimates. 
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on 
an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates 
are recognised in the period in which the estimates are 
revised and in future period which are affected.

**3.02	Critical accounting estimates**

**(a)	 Revenue recognition**

	
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable 
that the economic benefits will flow to the Company 
and the revenue can be reliably measured, regardless of 
when the payment is being made. Revenue is measured 
at the value of the consideration received or receivable, 
considering contractually defined terms of payment 
and excluding taxes or duties collected on behalf of the 
government.

	
The specific recognition criteria described below must 
also be met before revenue is recognised.

**Revenue from sale of goods and services**

	
Revenue is recognised when it is probable that 
economic benefits associated with a transaction 
flows to the Company in the ordinary course of its 
activities and the amount of revenue can be measured 
reliably. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the 
consideration received or receivable, net of returns & 
trade discounts.

	
Revenue includes only the gross inflows of economic 
benefits, received and receivable by the Company, on 
its own account. Amounts collected on behalf of third 
parties such as goods and service tax are excluded 
from revenue.

	
Revenue from sale of goods and services is recognised 
when the following conditions are satisfied:

	
•	
The Company has transferred the significant risks 
and rewards of ownership of the goods to the 
buyer.

	
•	
The 
Company 
retains 
neither 
continuing 

managerial involvement to the degree usually 
associated with ownership nor effective control 
over goods/services sold.

NOTES FORMING PART OF STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31ST MARCH, 2024 (Contd.)

	
•	
The amount of revenue can be measured reliably.

	
•	
It is probable that the economic benefits 
associated with the transaction will flow to the 
Company.

	
•	
The costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of 
the transaction can be measured reliably.

	
Revenue is recognised upon transfer of control of 
promised products or services to customers in an 
amount that reflects the consideration which the 
Company expects to receive in exchange for those 
products or services.

**Other income**

	
Dividend income is accounted for when the right to 
receive dividend is established.

	
Interest is recognised only when no uncertainty as 
a measurability or collectability exists. Interest on 
fixed deposits is recognised on time proportion basis 
considering the amount outstanding and the rate 
applicable.

	
Export Duty Drawback and RodTEP incentives are 
accounted on accrual basis when the certainty to 
receive is established.

**(b)	 Taxes**

**Current income tax**

	
Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured 
at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to 
the taxation authorities. The Company determines the 
tax as per the provisions of Income Tax Act 1961 and 
other rules specified thereunder.

	
Current income tax relating to items recognised 
outside the statement of profit and loss is recognised 
in other comprehensive income. Current tax items are 
recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction 
in OCI. Management periodically evaluates positions 
taken in the tax returns with respect to situations 
in which applicable tax regulations are subject to 
interpretation 
and 
establishes 
provisions 
where 

appropriate.

**Deferred tax**

	
Deferred tax is measured using the balance sheet 
approach on temporary differences between the 
tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying 
amounts for financial reporting purposes at the 
reporting date.

	
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable 
temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are 
recognised for all deductible temporary differences, the 
carry forward of unused tax credits and any unused tax 
losses. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent 

that it is probable that taxable profit will be available 
against which the deductible temporary differences, 
and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused 
tax losses can be utilised, except:

	
When the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible 
temporary difference arises from the initial recognition 
of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a 
business combination and, at the time of the transaction 
affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit 
or loss.

	
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed 
at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it 
is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will 
be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset 
to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are re-
assessed at each reporting date and are recognised 
to the extent that it has become probable that future 
taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be 
recovered.

	
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the 
tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when 
the asset is realised, or the liability is settled, based 
on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted at the reporting date.

	
Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside 
the statement of profit and loss is recognised in 
other comprehensive income. Deferred tax items are 
recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction 
in OCI.

	
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset 
if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax 
assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred 
taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same 
tax authority.

**(c)	 Property, plant & equipment**

	
Property, plant & equipment represent a significant 
proportion of the asset base of the Company. The 
charge in respect of depreciation is derived after 
determining an estimate of the asset’s expected useful 
life and estimated residual value at the end of its life. 
The useful lives and residual value of the Company’s 
assets are estimated by the management at the time 
the asset is acquired and reviewed periodically. The 
lives are based on historical experience with similar 
assets as well as anticipation of future events, which 
may impact their life, such as changes in technology.

**(d)	 Inventories**

	
The Company estimates the net realisable value (NRV) 
of its inventories by taking into account estimated 
selling price, estimated cost of completion, estimated 

----

NOTES FORMING PART OF STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31ST MARCH, 2024 (Contd.)

costs necessary to make the sale, obsolescence 
considering the past trend. Inventories are written 
down to NRV where such NRV is lower than their cost.

**(e)	 Leases**

	
Ind As 116 requires lessees to determine the lease 
term as non-cancellable period of a lease adjusted 
with any option to extend or terminate the lease, if the 
use of such option is reasonably certain. The Company 
makes an assessment on the expected lease term on 
a lease-by-lease basis and thereby assess whether 
its reasonably certain that any options to extend or 
terminate the contract will be exercised. In evaluating 
the lease term, the Company considers factors such 
as any significant leasehold improvements undertaken 
over the lease term, costs relating to the termination of 
the lease and the importance of the underlying asset to 
the Group’s operations taking into account the location 
of the asset and the availability of alternatives. The 
lease term in future period is reassessed to ensure 
that the lease term reflects the current economic 
circumstances. After considering current and future 
economic conditions, the Company has concluded that 
no changes are required to lease periods relating to 
existing lease contracts.

**(f)	
Provisions and contingent liabilities**

	
The Company estimates the provisions that have 
present obligation as a result of past events and it is 
probable that outflow of resources will be required to 
settle the obligations. These provisions are reviewed at 
the end of each reporting period and are adjusted to 
reflect the current best estimates. The Company has 
significant judgements to assess contingent liabilities.

**(g)	 Defined benefits and compensated absences.**

	
The cost of the defined plans, compensated absences 
and the present value of the defined benefit obligation 
are based on actuarial valuation using the projected 
unit credit method. An actuarial valuation involves 
making various assumptions that may differ from 
actual developments in the future. These include 
the determination of the discount rate, future salary 
increases and mortality rates. Due to the complexities 
involved in the valuation and its long term nature, a 
defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes 
on those assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at 
each reporting date.

**(h)	 Impairment of assets**

	
Investments in subsidiaries, goodwill and intangible 
assets are tested for impairment at least annually 
and when events occur or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the recoverable amount of the asset or 

cash generating units to which they pertain is less 
than its carrying value. The recoverable value of cash 
generating units is higher of value-in-use and fair value 
less cost to dispose. The calculation of value in use 
of a cash generating unit involves use of significant 
estimates and assumptions which includes turnover 
and earnings, multiples, growth rates and net margins 
used to calculate projected cash flows, risk adjusted 
discount rate, future economic and market conditions.

**3.03	Significant accounting policies**

**(a)	 Transactions and balances**

	
Transactions in foreign currency are translated into 
Indian rupees at the exchange rates at the date of the 
transaction.

	
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currency are translated at the functional currency spot 
rates of exchange at the reporting date. Exchange 
differences arising on settlement or translation of 
monetary items are recognised in the statement of 
profit or loss.

	
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of 
historical cost in foreign currency are translated using 
the exchange rates at the date of the initial transaction. 
Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign 
currency are translated using the exchange rates at the 
date when the fair value is determined. The gain or loss 
arising on translation of non-monetary items measured 
at fair value is treated in line with the recognition of 
the gain or loss on the change in fair value of the item 
(i.e., translation difference on items whose fair value 
gain or loss is recognised in the statement of Other 
Comprehensive Income (OCI) or the statement of profit 
or loss is also recognised in the statement of OCI or the 
statement of profit or loss, respectively).

	
Application of accounting policies that require critical 
accounting estimates and the assumptions having the 
most significant effect on the amounts recognised in 
the standalone financial statements are:

	
Valuation of financial instruments

	
Useful life of property, plant and equipment

	
Useful life of intangible assets

	
Provisions

**(b)	 Current versus non-current classification**

	
The Company presents assets and liabilities in 
the balance sheet based on current/ non-current 
classification. An asset is treated as current when it is:

	
•	
Expected to be realised or intended to be sold or 
consumed in normal operating cycle.

•	
Held primarily for trading.

	
•	
Expected to be realised within twelve months after 
the reporting period, or

	
•	
Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from 
being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at 
least twelve months after the reporting period.

	
All other assets are classified as non-current.

	
A liability is current when

	
•	
It is expected to be settled in normal operating 
cycle.

	
•	
It is held primarily for trading.

	
•	
It is due to be settled within twelve months after 
the reporting period, or

	
•	
There is no unconditional right to defer the 
settlement of the liability for at least twelve 
months after the reporting period.

	
The Company classifies all other liabilities as non-
current.

	
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-
current assets and liabilities.

	
The operating cycle is the time between the acquisition 
of assets for processing and their realisation in cash 
and cash equivalents. The Company has identified 
twelve months as its operating cycle.

**(c)	 Fair value measurement**

	
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell 
an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly 
transaction between market participants at the 
measurement date. The fair value measurement is 
based on the presumption that the transaction to sell 
the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:

	
In the principal market for the asset or liability, or

	
In the absence of a principal market, in the most 
advantageous market for the asset or liability.

	
The principal or the most advantageous market must 
be accessible by the Group.

	
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using 
the assumptions that market participants would use 
when pricing the asset or liability, if market participants 
act in their economic best interest.

	
A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset 
considers a market participant’s ability to generate 
economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and 
best use or by selling it to another market participant 
that would use the asset in its highest and best use.

	
The Company uses valuation techniques that are 
appropriate in the circumstances and for which 
sufficient data are available to measure fair value, 

maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and 
minimising the use of unobservable inputs.

	
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured 
or disclosed in the standalone financial statements are 
categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described 
as follows, based on the lowest level input that is 
significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:

	
Level 1 - Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active 
markets for identical assets or liabilities.

	
Level 2- Valuation techniques for which the lowest level 
input that is significant to the fair value measurement is 
directly or indirectly observable.

	
Level 3 -Valuation techniques for which the lowest level 
input that is significant to the fair value measurement is 
unobservable.

	
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in 
consolidated financial statements on a recurring 
basis, the Company determines whether transfers 
have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-
assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level 
input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.

	
The 
Company’s 
Management 
determines 
the 

policies and procedures for both; recurring fair value 
measurement, such as derivative instruments and 
unquoted financial assets measured at fair value, and 
for non-recurring measurement, such as assets held 
for distribution in discontinued operations.

	
At each reporting date, the Management analyses the 
movements in the values of assets and liabilities which 
are required to be re-measured or re-assessed as per 
the Company’s accounting policies. For this analysis, 
the Management verifies the major inputs applied in 
the latest valuation by agreeing the information in the 
valuation computation to contracts and other relevant 
documents.

	
The Management also compares the change in the fair 
value of each asset and liability with relevant external 
sources to determine whether the change is reasonable. 
For 	 the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Company 
has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the 
basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the 
asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy 
as explained above.

	
This note summarises accounting policy for fair value. 
Other fair value related disclosures are given in the 
relevant notes.

**(d)	 Property, plant and equipment**

	
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and where applicable

accumulated impairment losses. Property, plant 
and equipment and capital work in progress cost 
include expenditure that is directly attributable to the 
acquisition of the asset. The cost of self-constructed 
assets includes the cost of materials, direct labour and 
any other costs directly attributable to bringing the 
asset to a working condition for its intended use, and 
the costs of dismantling and removing the items and 
restoring the site on which they are located. Interest on 
Funds borrowed for acquisition of property, plant and 
equipment up to the period such property, plant and 
equipment is ready for use is capitalised and added to 
the cost of such items.

	
Gains and losses on disposal are determined by 
comparing the proceeds from disposal with the 
carrying amount of property, plant and equipment 
and are recognised net within “other income/other 
expenses” in the statement of profit and loss.

	
Depreciation in accounts is charged on Straight Line 
Method based on the management’s estimate of useful 
life of each class of assets and considering the useful 
life prescribed by Schedule II of the Companies Act, 
2013 on the cost, as reduced by the amount of Excise 
Cenvat, GST and VAT setoff claimed.

**Subsequent cost**

	
The cost of replacing part of an item of property, plant 
and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount 
of the item if it is probable that the future economic 
benefits embodied within the part will flow to the 
Company and its cost can be measured reliably. The 
costs of the day-to-day servicing of property, plant and 
equipment are recognised in the statement of profit 
and loss.

	
Depreciation is provided on Straight Line Method (SLM) 
basis, based on the estimated useful life of the assets.

The residual values, useful lives and methods of 
depreciation of property, plant and equipment are 

reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted 
prospectively, if appropriate.

	
Amortisation is provided on Straight Line Method (SLM) 
basis, based on the estimated useful life of the assets.

**(e) 	 Intangible assets**

	
Intangible assets acquired by the Company and 
having finite useful lives, are measured at cost 
less accumulated amortisation and accumulated 
impairment losses. Cost includes expenditure that is 
directly attributable to the acquisition of the intangible 
asset.

	
All revenue expenses pertaining to research are charged 
to the profit and loss account in the year in which they 
are incurred. Expenditure of capital nature is capitalised 
as property, plant and equipment and depreciated as 
per the Company’s policy.

	
Amortisation is provided on Straight Line Method (SLM) 
basis, based on the estimated useful life of the assets.

**Subsequent expenditure**

	
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it 
increases the future economic benefits embodied in the 
specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure, 
including expenditure on internally generated goodwill 
and brands, are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.

**Amortisation of intangible assets with finite useful 
lives:**

	
Amortisation is recognised in profit and loss on a 
straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of 
intangible assets from the date that they are available 
for use.

**(f) 	 Inventories**

	
Stock of raw materials, consumable stores and fuel 
and oil are valued at lower of cost or market value, on 
FIFO basis. Finished goods and work in progress are 
valued at cost of production or market value whichever 
is lower.

**(g)	 Earnings per share**

	
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing the 
profit / (loss) after tax (including the post-tax effect of 
extraordinary items, if any) by the weighted average 
number of equity shares outstanding during the year. 
Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing the 
profit / (loss) after tax (including the post-tax effect of 
extraordinary items, if any) as adjusted for dividend, 
interest and other charges to expense or income

relating to the dilutive potential equity shares, by the 
weighted average number of equity shares considered 
for deriving basic earnings per share and the weighted 
average number of equity shares which could have 
been issued on the conversion of all dilutive potential 
equity shares. Potential equity shares are deemed 
to be dilutive only if their conversion to equity shares 
would decrease the net profit per share from continuing 
ordinary operations. Potential dilutive equity shares 
are deemed to be converted as at the beginning of the 
period, unless they have been issued at a later date. 
The dilutive potential equity shares are adjusted for 
the proceeds receivable had the shares been actually 
issued at fair value (i.e. average market value of the 
outstanding shares). Dilutive potential equity shares are 
determined independently for each period presented. 
The number of equity shares and potentially dilutive 
equity shares are adjusted for share splits / reverse 
share splits and bonus shares, as appropriate.

**(h)	 Borrowing costs**

	
Borrowing costs include interest, amortisation of 
ancillary costs incurred and exchange differences 
arising from foreign currency borrowings to the extent 
they are regarded as an adjustment to the interest 
cost. Borrowing cost directly attributable to the cost 
of acquisition or construction of the fixed assets is 
capitalised as part of the cost of the assets, upto the 
date the asset is put to use. Other borrowing costs are 
charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss in the year 
in which they are incurred Costs in connection with the 
borrowing of funds are charged to statement of profit 
and loss.

**(i)	
Provisions and contingent liabilities**

	
The Company recognises a provision when there is a 
present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a 
past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources 
will be required to settle the obligation and the amount 
can be reliably estimated.

	
Long term provisions are measured at the present value 
of management’s best estimate of the expenditure 
required to settle the present obligation at the end of the 
reporting period. The discount rate used to determine 
the present value is a pre-tax rate that reflects current 
market assessments of the time value of money and 
the risks specific to the liability. The increase in the 
provision due to the passage of time is recognised as 
interest expense.

	
A disclosure for a contingent liability is made when 
there is a possible obligation or a present obligation 
that may, but probably will not, require an outflow of 

resources. Where there is a possible obligation or a 
present obligation that the likelihood of outflow of 
resources is remote, no provision or disclosure is made.

**(j)	
Impairment of non-financial assets**

	
The Company assesses, at each reporting date, whether 
there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. 
If any indication exists, or when annual impairment 
testing for an asset is required, the Company estimates 
the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable 
amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating 
unit’s (CGU) fair value less costs of disposal and its 
value in use. Recoverable amount is determined for 
an individual asset unless the asset does not generate 
cash inflows that are largely independent of those from 
other assets or Company’s assets. When the carrying 
amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable 
amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written 
down to its recoverable amount.

**(k)	 Financial instruments**

	
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to 
a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or 
equity instrument of another entity.

**Financial asset**

**Initial recognition and measurement**

	
All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value 
plus, in the case of financial assets not recorded at fair 
value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are 
attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. 
Purchase or sale of financial assets that require delivery 
of assets within a time frame established by regulation 
or convention in the market place (regular way trades) 
are recognised on the trade date, i.e., the date that the 
Company commits to purchase or sell the assets.

	
Investment in subsidiaries are carried at cost less 
impairment losses, if any. Where an indication 
of impairment exists, the carrying amount of the 
investment is assessed and written down immediately 
to its recoverable amount.

**Subsequent measurement**

	
For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial 
assets are classified in four categories;

	
at amortised cost through profit or loss

	
at amortised cost through other comprehensive income

	
at fair value through other comprehensive income

	
at fair value through profit or loss

**Financial assets at amortised cost**

	
A financial asset is measured at the amortised cost if 
both the following conditions are met:

----

NOTES FORMING PART OF STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31ST MARCH, 2024 (Contd.)

	
The asset is held within a business model whose 
objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual 
cash flows, and

	
Contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified 
dates to cash flows that are solely payments of 
principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount 
outstanding.

	
This category is the most relevant to the Company. All 
the Loans and other receivables under financial assets 
(except investments) are non-derivative financial 
assets with fixed or determinable payments that are 
not quoted in an active market. Trade receivables do 
not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal 
value as reduced by impairment amount.

	
After initial measurement, such financial assets are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest rate (EIR) method. Amortised cost 
is calculated by taking into account any discount or 
premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an 
integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included 
in finance income in the statement of profit and loss. 
The losses arising from impairment are recognised in 
the statement of profit and loss. This category generally 
applies to trade and other receivables.

**Financial assets at fair value through the statement of 
profit and loss/other comprehensive income**

	
Instruments included within the FVTPL category are 
measured at fair value with all changes recognised in 
the statement of profit and loss.

	
If the Company decides to classify an instrument as at 
FVTOCI, then all fair value changes on the instrument, 
excluding dividends, are recognised in the statement of 
OCI. There is no recycling of the amounts from OCI to 
Statement of Profit & Loss, even on sale of investment. 
However, the Company may transfer the cumulative 
gain or loss within equity.

**De-recognition**

	
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a 
financial asset or part of a Company of similar financial 
assets) is primarily derecognised (i.e. removed from the 
Company’s balance sheet) when:

	
The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have 
expired, or

	
The Company has transferred its rights to receive cash 
flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to 
pay the received cash flows in full without material lay to 
a third party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; and 
either (a) the Company has transferred substantially all 
the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Company 
has neither transferred nor retained substantially all 

the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred 
control of the asset.

	
When the Company has transferred its rights to 
receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into 
a pass-through arrangement, it evaluates if and to 
what extent it has retained the risks and rewards of 
ownership. When it has neither transferred nor retained 
substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset, 
nor transferred control of the asset, the Company 
continues to recognise the transferred asset to the 
extent of the Company’s continuing involvement. In 
that case, the Company also recognises an associated 
liability. The transferred asset and the associated 
liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights 
and obligations that the Company has retained.

**Impairment of financials assets**

	
The Management has evaluated the impairment 
provision requirement under IND AS 109 and has listed 
below major facts for trade and other receivables 
impairment provisioning:

	
The Company does not have any purchased or 
originated credit-impaired (POCI) financial assets, i.e., 
financial assets which are credit impaired on purchase/ 
origination.

	
Expected Credit Loss (ECL) impairment loss allowance 
(or reversal) recognised during the period is recognised 
as income/ expense in the statement of profit and 
loss. This amount is reflected under the head ‘other 
expenses’ in the Statement of Profit & Loss. The balance 
sheet presentation for various financial instruments is 
described below:

	
Financial assets measured as at amortised cost 
and other contractual revenue receivables- ECL is 
presented as an allowance, i.e., as an integral part of the 
measurement of those assets in the balance sheet. The 
allowance reduces the net carrying amount. Until the 
asset meets write-off criteria, the Company does not 
reduce impairment allowance from the gross carrying 
amount.

	
Financial assets measured at FVTOCI- Since financial 
assets are already reflected at fair value, impairment 
allowance is not further reduced from its value. Rather, 
ECL amount is presented as ‘accumulated impairment 
amount’ in the OCI.

**Financial liabilities**

**Initial recognition and measurement**

	
Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, 
as financial liabilities at fair value through the statement 
of profit or loss, loans and borrowings, trade payables 
and other payables.

----

NOTES FORMING PART OF STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31ST MARCH, 2024 (Contd.)

	
All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value 
and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, 
net of directly attributable transaction costs.

	
The Company’s financial liabilities include trade and 
other payables, loans and borrowings including other 
payables.

**Subsequent measurement**

	
The measurement of financial liabilities depends on 
their classification, as described below:

**Loans and borrowings**

	
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and 
borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised 
cost using the EIR method. Gains and losses are 
recognised in the statement of profit and loss when the 
liabilities are derecognised as well as through the EIR 
amortisation process.

	
Amortised cost is calculated by considering any 
discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs 
that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation 
is included as finance costs in the Statement of Profit 
and Loss.

	
This category generally applies to interest-bearing 
loans and borrowings.

**De-recognition**

	
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation 
under the liability is discharged, cancelled or it expires. 
When an existing financial liability is replaced by another 
from the same lender on substantially different terms, 
or the terms of an existing liability are substantially 
modified, such an exchange or modification is treated 
as the de-recognition of the original liability and the 
recognition of a new liability. The difference in the 
respective carrying amounts is recognised in the 
statement of profit and loss.

**Offsetting of financial instruments**

	
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset 
and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet 
if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset 
the recognised amounts and there is an intention to 
settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the 
liabilities simultaneously.

**(l)	
Cash and cash equivalents**

	
For presentation in the statement of cash flows, cash 
and cash equivalents includes cash on hand, deposits 
held at call with financial institutions, other short-term, 
highly liquid investments with original maturities of 
three months or less that are readily convertible to 
known amounts of cash and which are subject to an 

insignificant risk of changes in value. Bank overdrafts 
and cash credits are shown within borrowings in 
current liabilities in the balance sheet.

**(m)	 Employee benefits**

**Defined contribution plans (Provident Fund)**

	
In accordance with Indian Law, eligible employees 
receive benefits from Provident Fund, which is defined 
contribution plan. Both the employee and employer 
make monthly contributions to the plan, which is 
administrated by the Government authorities, each 
equal to the specific percentage of employee’s basic 
salary. The Company has no further obligation under 
the plan beyond its monthly contributions. Obligation 
for contributions to the plan is recognised as an 
employee benefit expense in the Statement of Profit 
and Loss when incurred.

**Defined benefit plans (Gratuity)**

	
In accordance with applicable Indian Law, the Company 
provides for gratuity, a defined benefit retirement plan 
(the Gratuity Plan) covering eligible employees. The 
Gratuity Plan provides a lump sum payment to vested 
employees, at retirement or termination of employment, 
and amount based on respective last drawn salary 
and the years of employment with the Company. The 
Company’s net obligation in respect of the Gratuity 
Plan is calculated by estimating the amount of future 
benefits that the employees have earned in return 
of their service in the current and prior periods; that 
benefit is discounted to determine its present value. 
Any unrecognised past service cost and the fair value 
of plan assets are deducted. The discount rate is the 
yield at reporting date on risk free government bonds 
that have maturity dates approximating the terms of 
the Company’s obligation. The calculation is performed 
annually by a qualified actuary using the projected unit 
credit method. When the calculation results in a benefit 
to the Company, the recognised asset is limited to the 
total of any unrecognised past service cost and the 
present value of the economic benefits available in the 
form of any future refunds from the plan or reduction 
in future contribution to the plan. The Company 
recognises all re-measurements of net defined benefit 
liability/asset directly in other comprehensive income.

**Compensated absences**

	
The employees of the Company are entitled to 
compensated absences. The employees can carry 
forward a portion of the unutilised accrued absence and 
utilise it in future periods or receive cash compensation 
at retirement or termination of employment for the 
unutilised 
accrued 
compensated 
absence. 
The 

----

NOTES FORMING PART OF STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31ST MARCH, 2024 (Contd.)

Company recognises an obligation for compensated 
absences in the period in which the employee renders 
the services. The Company provides for the expected 
cost of compensated absence in the statement of profit 
and loss as the additional amount that the Company 
expects to pay as a result of the unused entitlement 
that has accumulated based on actuarial valuations 
carried out by an independent actuary at the balance 
sheet date.

**(n)	 Segment reporting**

	
The Company has presented data relating to its 
segments based on its standalone financial statements 
which are presented in the same Integrated Annual 
Report. Accordingly, in terms of paragraph 4 of the 
Indian Accounting Standard (Ind AS 108) “Operating 
Segments” no disclosures related to segments are 
presented in these standalone financial statements.

**(o)	 Leases**

	
A lease that transfers substantially all the risks and 
rewards incidental to ownership to the lessee is 
classified as a finance lease. All other leases are 
classified as operating leases.

**Company as a lessee**

	
Finance leases are capitalised at the commencement 
of the lease at the inception date fair value of the leased 
property or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum 
lease payments. The corresponding liability to the 
lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance 
lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned 
between finance charges and reduction of the lease 
liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on 
the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges 
are recognised in profit or loss as finance costs, unless 
they are directly attributable to qualifying assets, in 
which case they are capitalised in accordance with 
the Company’s general policy on the borrowing costs. 
Contingent rentals are recognised as expenses in the 
periods in which they are incurred.

	
Operating lease payments are generally recognised as 
an expense in the profit or loss on a straight-line basis 
over the lease term. Where the rentals are structured 

solely to increase in line with expected general inflation 
to compensate for the lessor’s expected inflationary 
cost increases, such increases are recognised in the 
year in which such benefits accrue.

**Ind AS 116 Leases:**

	
In March 2019, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, 
issued the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) 
Amendment Rules 2018, notifying Ind AS 116 “Leases” 
which replaces Ind AS 17 “Leases”. The new standard 
shall require lessees to recognise the Leases on their 
Balance Sheet with limited exemptions related to low 
value asset and assets with a lease term of less than 
12 months.

	
Lessees will use a single accounting model for all 
leases. Accordingly, the lessee is required to recognise 
“Right of Use” asset representing its right to use the 
underlying asset and a “Lease Liability” representing its 
obligations to make lease payments.

**(p)	 Government Grants**

	
Government grants are initially recognised at fair 
value if there is reasonable assurance that they will 
be received and the Company will comply with the 
conditions associated with the grant;

	
In case of capital grants, the amount of grant received 
is set off against the value of the property, plant and 
equipment against which the grant has been given.

	
In case of grants that compensate the Company for 
expenses incurred are recognised in Statement of 
Profit and Loss on a systematic basis in the periods in 
which the expenses are recognised.

	
Export benefits available under prevalent schemes are 
accrued in the year in which the goods are exported 
and there is no uncertainty in receiving the same.

**(q)	 Recent accounting pronouncements**

	
Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies new 
standards or amendments to the existing standards 
under Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) 
Rules as issued from time to time. For the year ended 

31st March, 2024, MCA has not notified any new 
standards or amendments to the existing standards 
applicable to the Group.

**38. FAIR VALUES**

Fair value measurement includes both the significant financial instruments stated at amortised cost and at fair value in the 
statement of financial position. The carrying values of current financial instruments approximate their fair values due to the 
short-term maturity of these instruments and the disclosures of fair value are not made when the carrying amount of current 
financial instruments is a reasonable approximation of the fair value. The carrying values of the long-term financial instruments 
approximates the fair values as the management has considered the fair value measurement techniques using the observable 
data i.e. the discounting rate which was similar as to rates, tenure and the credit rating of the other instruments of the Company. 
The management has also considered the effect of time value of money with respect to other long term financial instruments 
at applicables rates.	

**39. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES**

The Company’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk,credit risk and liquidity risk. The Company’s risk 
management assessment and policies and processes are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Company, 
to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor such risks and compliance with the same.	

The Company has constituted a Risk Management Committee consisting of its directors. The Company has a robust risk 
management policy to identify, evaluate business risks and opportunities. This policy seeks to create transparency, minimise 
adverse impact on the business objectives and enhance the Company’s competitive advantage.

**40. CREDIT RISK**

Credit risk arises from the possibility that customers shall not be able to settle their obligations as agreed and arises principally 
from the Company’s receivables from customers, loans and investments. Credit risk is managed through credit approvals, 
establishing credit limits and continuously monitoring the creditworhtiness of counterparty to which the Company grants credit 
terms in the normal course of business.	

**Investments**

The Company limits its exposure to credit risk by investing in liquid securities which primarily include mutual fund units. 
The Company mitigates risk from non-performance of these securities by ensuring that it does not have any significant 
concentration of exposures to specific industry sectors or specific country risks.

**Trade receivables**

Trade receivables are typically unsecured and derived from income earned from customers. On account of adoption of Ind AS 
109, the Company uses expected credit loss model to assess the impairment loss or gain, however this is modified if in the past 
experience of the Company, there is likely mitigation of the credit risk.

**41. MARKET RISK**

Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in 
market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk, such as equity 
price risk and commodity risk. The value of a financial instrument shall change as a result of changes in the interest rates, 
foreign currency exchange rates, equity price fluctuations, liquidity and other market changes. Financial instruments affected 
by market risk include loans and borrowings, deposits and investments.

**42. FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK**

Foreign exchange risk arises on future commercial transactions and on all recognised monetary assets and liabilities, which 
are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the Company. The Company’s management has set policy 
wherein exposure is identified, benchmark is set and monitored closely, and accordingly suitable hedges are undertaken. The 
Company’s foreign currency exposure arises mainly from foreign exchange imports and exports, primarily with respect to US$, 
JPY and EUR.

**44. LIQUIDITY RISK**

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they become due. The objective 
of liquidity risk management is to maintain sufficient liquidity and ensure that funds are available for use as per requirements.

The Company manages the liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities, 
by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows, and by matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and 
liabilities. The Company invests its surplus funds in bank fixed deposits and liquid schemes of mutual funds which carry limited 
mark to market risks. The Company also invests in equity schemes of mutual funds which carry liquidity and rate return risks.

**45. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT**

For the purpose of the Company’s capital management, capital includes issued equity capital, share premium and all other 
equity reserves attributable to the equity holders of the Company. The primary objective of the Company’s capital management 
is to maximise the value of shareholder. 

The Company monitors capital using Capital Gearing Ratio, which is net debt divided by total capital. Net debt includes loans 
and borrowings, trade and other payables, less cash and cash equivalents.

To achieve the overall objective, the Company’s capital management aims to ensure that it meets the financial covenants 
attached to loans and borrowings. Breaches in meeting the covenants would permit the bank to immediately call loans and 
borrowings. There have been no breaches in the financial covenants of any loans and borrowings in the current year.

and other explanatory information (hereinafter referred to as 
“the consolidated Ind AS financial statements”).

In our opinion and to the best of our information and 
according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid 
consolidated Ind AS financial statements give the 
information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”) 
in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in

**INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT**

March 31, 2024, the consolidated profit and total 
comprehensive income, consolidated changes in equity and 
its consolidated cash flows for the year ended on that date.

Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit of the consolidated Ind AS financial 
statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing 
(SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act (SAs). 
Our responsibilities under those Standards are further 
described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of 
the consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements section of 
our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance 
with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India (ICAI) together with the independence 
and ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of 
the consolidated Ind AS financial statements under the 
provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder, and we 
have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance 
with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We 
believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on 
the consolidated Ind AS financial statements.

Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters (“KAM”) are those matters that, in our 
professional judgment, were of most significance in our 
audit of the consolidated Ind AS financial statements of the 
current period. These matters were addressed in the context 
of our audit of the consolidated Ind AS financial statements 
as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do 
not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have 
determined the matters described below to be the key audit 
matters to be communicated in our report.

**Key Audit Report
How was the matter addressed in our audit**

**Revenue Recognition**

Revenue is recognised upon transfer of control of promised 
goods to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration 
which the Group expects to receive in exchange for those 
goods. Revenue is measured based on transaction price, 
which is the consideration, adjusted for rebates, discounts and 
incentives as also estimated sales returns.

Revenue is one of the key profit drivers and therefore, 
accounting of revenue is considered as a key audit matter.

[Refer Note 4 (a) to the consolidated financial statements]

**Our audit procedures, among other things, included the 
following:**

•	
Considered the appropriateness of the Group’s accounting 
policies regarding revenue recognition

•	
Testing 
controls, 
automated 
and

and process of confirmation of receivable balances, testing 
for cut-offs and analytical review procedures.

Assessed the disclosures in accordance with the 
requirements of Ind AS 115 on “Revenue from Contracts 
with Customers”.

The Group has complex product manufacturing process and 
thus, the overhead absorption over each process is quite 
complex and more particularly, to have the basis of absorption. 
The Group has worked out the overhead absorption cost rate 
based on the consumption of electricity of each process and 
apply the same for all other overheads.

Due to significance of arriving at the overhead absorption rate 
for the valuation of inventories, it is considered to be a key 
audit matter.

[Refer Note 4(d) to the consolidated financial statements]

**Our audit procedures, among other things, included the 
following:**

•	
Evaluated the appropriateness of the basis applied to 
arrive at the overhead absorption rate;

•

**Information Other than the consolidated Ind AS Financial 
Statements and Auditor’s Report Thereon**

The Group’s Board of Directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the other information. The other information 
comprises the information included in the Management 
Discussion and Analysis, Board’s Report including Annexures 
to Board’s Report, Business Responsibility Report, Corporate 
Governance and Shareholder’s Information, but does not 
include the consolidated Ind AS financial statements and our 
auditor’s report thereon.

Our opinion on the consolidated Ind AS financial statements 
does not cover the other information and we do not express 
any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the consolidated Ind AS 
financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other 
information and, in doing so, consider whether the other 

information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated 
Ind AS financial statements or our knowledge obtained 
during the course of our audit or otherwise appears to be 
materially misstated.

If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that 
there is a material misstatement of this other information, 
we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report 
in this regard.

**Management’s Responsibility for the consolidated Ind AS 
Financial Statements**

The Group’s Board of Directors are responsible for the 
matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Companies Act, 2013 
(“the Act”) with respect to preparation of these consolidated 
Ind AS financial statements that give a true and fair view of 
the consolidated financial position, consolidated financial 
performance, consolidated total other comprehensive 
income, consolidated cash flows and changes in equity 
of the Group in accordance with the Indian Accounting 
Standards (Ind AS) prescribed under Section 133 of the 
Act, read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standard) 
Rules, 2015 as amended, and other accounting principles 
generally accepted in India.

This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate 
accounting records in accordance with the provisions of 
the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Group and for 
preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; 
selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; 
making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of 
adequate internal financial controls, that were operating 
effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness 
of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and 

presentation of the consolidated Ind AS financial statements 
that give a true and fair view and are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated Ind AS financial statements, 
the management is responsible for assessing the Group’s 
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as 
applicable, matters related to going concern and using the 
going concern basis of accounting unless management 
either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, 
or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

The respective Board of Directors of the companies included 
in the Group are also responsible for overseeing the Group’s 
financial reporting process.

**Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the consolidated 
Ind AS Financial Statements**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the consolidated Ind AS financial statements as a 
whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our 
opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, 
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance 
with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it 
exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they 
could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated 
financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:

•	
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement 
of the consolidated Ind AS financial statements, 
whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit 
procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit 
evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a 
basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material 
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for 
one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, 
forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or 
the override of internal control.

•	
Obtain an understanding of internal financial controls 
relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures 
that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under 
section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible 
for expressing our opinion on whether the Group has 
adequate internal financial controls system in place 
and the operating effectiveness of such controls.

•	
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies 
used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates 
and related disclosures made by management.

•	
Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s 
use of the going concern basis of accounting and, 
based on the audit evidence obtained, whether 
a material uncertainty exists related to events or 
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the 
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we 
conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are 
required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the 
related disclosures in the consolidated Ind AS financial 
statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to 
modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the 
audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s 
report. However, future events or conditions may cause 
the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.

•	
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content 
of the consolidated Ind AS financial statements, 
including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated 
Ind AS financial statements represent the underlying 
transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair 
presentation.

Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the 
consolidated Ind AS financial statements that, individually or 
in aggregate, makes it probable that the economic decisions 
of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the financial 
statements may be influenced. We consider quantitative 
materiality and qualitative factors in (i) planning the scope of 
our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work; and 
(ii) to evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in 
the financial statements.

We communicate with those charged with governance 
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and 
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including 
any significant deficiencies in internal control that we 
identify during our audit. We also provide those charged 
with governance with a statement that we have complied 
with relevant ethical requirements regarding Independence, 
and to communicate with them all relationships and other 
matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
Independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of most 
significance in the audit of the consolidated Ind AS financial 
statements of the current period and are therefore the key 
audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s 
report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure 
about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, 

we determine that a matter should not be communicated 
in our report because the adverse consequences of doing 
so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public 
interest benefits of such communication.

Report on the Internal Financial Controls over financial reporting under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the 
Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”)

**ANNEXURE - A 
TO THE AUDITOR’S REPORT**

We have audited the internal financial controls over financial 
reporting of the Group as of 31st March, 2024 in conjunction 
with our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the 
Group for the year ended on that date.

**MANAGEMENT’S 
RESPONSIBILITY 
FOR 
INTERNAL**

**FINANCIAL CONTROLS**

The Group’s management is responsible for establishing 
and maintaining internal financial controls based on the 
internal control over financial reporting criteria established 
by the Group considering the essential components of 
internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of 
Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting issued 
by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (‘ICAI’). 
These responsibilities include the design, implementation 
and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls 
that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly 
and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence 
to Group’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the 
prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy 
and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely 
preparation of reliable financial information, as required 
under the Companies Act, 2013.

**AUDITORS’ RESPONSIBILITY**

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Group’s 
internal financial controls over financial reporting based on 
our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the 
Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls over 
Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) and the Standards 
on Auditing, issued by ICAI and deemed to be prescribed 
under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013, to the 
extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls, 
both applicable to an audit of Internal Financial Controls 
and, both issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of 
India. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that 
we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform 
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
adequate internal financial controls over financial reporting 
was established and maintained and if such controls 
operated effectively in all material respects.

Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit 
evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial 
controls system over financial reporting and their operating 
effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls over 
financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of 

internal financial controls over financial reporting, assessing 
the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and 
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal 
control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected 
depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment 
of the risks of material misstatement of the financial 
statements, whether due to fraud or error.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit 
opinion on the Group’s internal financial controls system 
over financial reporting.

**MEANING OF INTERNAL FINANCIAL CONTROLS OVER 
FINANCIAL REPORTING**

A Group’s internal financial control over financial reporting 
is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance 
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the 
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
A Group’s internal financial control over financial reporting 
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the 
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately 
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the 
assets of the Group; (2) provide reasonable assurance 
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit 
preparation of financial statements in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts 
and expenditures of the Group are being made only in 
accordance with authorisations of management and 
directors of the Group; and (3) provide reasonable assurance 
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised 
acquisition, use, or disposition of the Group’s assets that 
could have a material effect on the financial statements.

**INHERENT 
LIMITATIONS 
OF 
INTERNAL 
FINANCIAL**

**CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING**

Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial 
controls over financial reporting, including the possibility 
of collusion or improper management override of controls, 
material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and 
not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the 
internal financial controls over financial reporting to future 
periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial 
control over financial reporting may become inadequate 
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of 
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

**OPINION**

In our opinion, the Group has, in all material respects, an 
adequate internal financial controls system over financial 
reporting and such internal financial controls over financial 
reporting were operating effectively as at 31 March, 2024, 
based on the internal control over financial reporting 
criteria established by the Group considering the essential 
components of internal control stated in the Guidance 

Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial 
Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants 
of India.

manufacturer of pharmaceuticals and intermediates for 
usage in veterinary and human health. The Group caters 
to various global companies to custom manufacture 
high quality pharmaceuticals. Macrotech Polychem 
Private Limited, a private Group domiciled in India and 
incorporated under the provisions of the Companies 
Act, 1956 (CIN: U24100MH2004PTC145189) is a 100% 
subsidiary of NGL Fine-Chem Limited.

**2.
Basis of preparation**

	
Financial statements for the year ended 31st March, 
2024 are prepared in accordance with Indian 
Accounting Standards notified under the Companies 
(Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 together 
with comparative period data as at and for the year 
ended 31st March, 2023.

	
The consolidated financial statements have been 
prepared on accrual basis and under the historical cost 
convention except for certain financial instruments 
which are measured at fair value. Historical cost is 
generally based on the fair value of consideration given 
in exchange of goods and services. The accounting 
policies are consistently applied by the Group during 
the period and are consistent with those used in the 
previous year except where a newly issued accounting 
standard is initially adopted or a revision to an 
existing accounting standard requires a change in the 
accounting policy hitherto in use.

	
The consolidated financial statements are prepared 
in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind 
AS 34) as prescribed by Section 133 of the Companies 
Act 2013 (“the Act”) read with the Companies (Indian 
Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 and guidelines 
issued by the Securities and Exchange Board of India 
(SEBI). These consolidated financial statements do not 
include all the information required for a complete set of 
consolidated financial statements under the applicable 
financial reporting framework. The consolidated financial 
statements are presented in Indian ` Lakh (functional 
currency of the Group) unless otherwise stated.

**3.
BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION**

	
Consolidated financial statements for the year ended 
31st March, 2024 are prepared in accordance with Indian 
Accounting Standards notified under the Companies 

NOTES FORMING PART OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31ST MARCH, 2024

(Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 including 
IndAS 110 – Accounting standard on “Consolidated 
Financial Statements” together with comparative 
period data as at and for the year ended 31st March, 
2023.

	
The parent Group consolidated entities which it owns 
or controls. The consolidated financial statements 
comprise the financial statements of the parent Group 
and its subsidiary. Control exists when the parent Group 
has power over the entity, is exposed or has rights to 
variable returns from its involvement with the entity; 
and has the ability to affect those returns by using its 
power over the entity. Power is demonstrated through 
existing rights that give the ability to direct relevant 
activities, those which significantly affect the entity’s 
returns. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date 
control commences till the date control ceases.

	
The financial statements have been consolidated on 
line-by-line basis by adding together the book values 
of like items of assets and liabilities, income and 
expenses after eliminating intra group balances and 
intra group transactions except where cost cannot be 
recovered. The unrealised profits or losses resulting 
from intra group transactions and balances have been 
eliminated. The financial statements of the Group and 
its subsidiary have been consolidated using uniform 
accounting policies for like transactions and other 
events in similar circumstances as mentioned in those 
policies, unless otherwise mentioned separately under 
these notes

**4.
MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION**

**4.1 	 Use of estimates and judgement**

	
The preparation of consolidated financial statements 
in conformity with Ind AS requires management 
to make judgments, estimates and assumptions 
that affect the application of accounting policies 
and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, the 
disclosures of contingent assets and contingent 
liabilities at the date of financial statements, and the 
income and expenses during the reporting period. 
The application of accounting policies that require 
critical accounting estimates involving complex and 
subjective judgements and use of assumptions in these 
consolidated financial statements have been disclosed 
appropriately. Accounting estimates could change 
from period to period. Actual results may differ from 
these estimates. Appropriate changes in estimates 
are made as the management becomes aware of 
changes in circumstances surrounding the estimates. 
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on 
an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates 

----

Financial Statements

203

are recognised in the period in which the estimates are 
revised and in future period which are affected.

**4.2 	 Critical accounting estimates**

**(a)	 Revenue recognition**

	
	
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is 
probable that the economic benefits will flow 
to the Group and the revenue can be reliably 
measured, regardless of when the payment is 
being made. Revenue is measured at the value 
of the consideration received or receivable, 
considering 
contractually 
defined 
terms 
of 

payment and excluding taxes or duties collected 
on behalf of the government.

	
	
The specific recognition criteria described below 
must also be met before revenue is recognised.

**Revenue from sale of goods and services**

	
	
Revenue is recognised when it is probable that 
economic benefits associated with a transaction 
flows to the Group in the ordinary course of its 
activities and the amount of revenue can be 
measured reliably. Revenue is measured at the fair 
value of the consideration received or receivable, 
net of returns & trade discounts.

	
	
Revenue includes only the gross inflows of 
economic benefits, received and receivable by the 
Group, on its own account. Amounts collected on 
behalf of third parties such as goods and service 
tax are excluded from revenue.

	
	
Revenue from sale of goods and services is 
recognised when the following conditions are 
satisfied:

	
	
i.	
The Group has transferred the significant 
risks and rewards of ownership of the goods 
to the buyer.

	
	
ii.	
The 
Group 
retains 
neither 
continuing 

managerial involvement to the degree usually 
associated with ownership nor effective 
control over goods/services sold.

	
	
iii.	
The amount of revenue can be measured 
reliably.

	
	
iv.	
It is probable that the economic benefits 
associated with the transaction will flow to 
the Group.

	
	
v.	
The costs incurred or to be incurred in 
respect of the transaction can be measured 
reliably.

	
	
Revenue is recognised upon transfer of control of 
promised products or services to customers in an 
amount that reflects the consideration which the 

Group expects to receive in exchange for those 
products or services.

**Other income**

	
	
Dividend income is accounted for when the right 
to received dividend is established.

	
	
Interest is recognised only when no uncertainty 
as to measurability or collectability exists. Interest 
on fixed deposit is recognised on time proportion 
basis considering the amount outstanding and 
the rate applicable.

	
	
Export Duty Drawback and RodTEP incentives are 
accounted on accrual basis when the certainty to 
receive is established.

**(b)	 Taxes**

**Current income tax**

	
	
Current income tax assets and liabilities are 
measured at the amount expected to be recovered 
from or paid to the taxation authorities. The Group 
determines the tax as per the provisions of Income 
Tax Act 1961 and other rules specified thereunder.

	
	
Current income tax relating to items recognised 
outside the statement of profit and loss is 
recognised in other comprehensive income. 
Current tax items are recognised in correlation to 
the underlying transaction in OCI. Management 
periodically evaluates positions taken in the 
tax returns with respect to situations in which 
applicable 
tax 
regulations 
are 
subject 
to 

interpretation and establishes provisions where 
appropriate.

**Deferred tax**

	
	
Deferred tax is measured using the balance sheet 
approach on temporary differences between 
the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their 
carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes 
at the reporting date.

	
	
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all 
taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax 
assets are recognised for all deductible temporary 
differences, the carry forward of unused tax credits 
and any unused tax losses. Deferred tax assets 
are recognised to the extent that it is probable that 
taxable profit will be available against which the 
deductible temporary differences, and the carry 
forward of unused tax credits and unused tax 
losses can be utilised, except:

	
	
When the deferred tax asset relating to the 
deductible temporary difference arises from 
the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a 

NOTES FORMING PART OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31ST MARCH, 2024 (Contd.)

----

transaction that is not a business combination 
and, at the time of the transaction affects neither 
the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.

	
	
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is 
reviewed at each reporting date and reduced 
to the extent that it is no longer probable that 
sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow 
all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. 
Unrecognised deferred tax assets are re-assessed 
at each reporting date and are recognised to the 
extent that it has become probable that future 
taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to 
be recovered.

	
	
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at 
the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year 
when the asset is realised, or the liability is settled, 
based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting 
date.

	
	
Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside 
the statement of profit and loss is recognised in 
other comprehensive income. Deferred tax items 
are recognised in correlation to the underlying 
transaction in OCI.

	
	
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are 
offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off 
current tax assets against current tax liabilities 
and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable 
entity and the same tax authority.

**(c)	 Property, plant & equipment**

	
	
Property, plant & equipment represent a significant 
proportion of the asset base of the Group. The 
charge in respect of depreciation is derived after 
determining an estimate of the asset’s expected 
useful life and estimated residual value at the 
end of its life. The useful lives and residual value 
of the Group’s assets are estimated by the 
management at the time the asset is acquired 
and reviewed periodically. The lives are based on 
historical experience with similar assets as well as 
anticipation of future events, which may impact 
their life, such as changes in technology.

**(d)	 Inventories**

	
	
The Group estimates the net realisable value 
(NRV) of its inventories by taking into account 
estimated selling price, estimated cost of 
completion, estimated costs necessary to make 
the sale, obsolescence considering the past trend. 
Inventories are written down to NRV where such 
NRV is lower than their cost.

**(e)	 Leases**

	
	
Ind As 116 requires lessees to determine the lease 
term as non-cancellable period of a lease adjusted 
with any option to extend or terminate the lease, if 
the use of such option is reasonably certain. The 
Group makes an assessment on the expected 
lease term on a lease-by-lease basis and thereby 
assess whether its reasonably certain that any 
options to extend or terminate the contract will 
be exercised. In evaluating the lease term, the 
Group considers factors such as any significant 
leasehold improvements undertaken over the 
lease term, costs relating to the termination of the 
lease and the importance of the underlying asset 
to the Group’s operations taking into account 
the location of the asset and the availability of 
alternatives. The lease term in future period 
is reassessed to ensure that the lease term 
reflects the current economic circumstances. 
After considering current and future economic 
conditions, the Group has concluded that no 
changes are required to lease periods relating to 
existing lease contracts.

**(f)	
Provisions and contingent liabilities**

	
	
The Group estimates the provisions that have 
present obligation as a result of past events and 
it is probable that outflow of resources will be 
required to settle the obligations. These provisions 
are reviewed at the end of each reporting period 
and are adjusted to reflect the current best 
estimates. The Group has significant judgements 
to assess contingent liabilities.

**(g)	 Defined benefits and compensated absences.**

	
	
The cost of the defined plans, compensated 
absences and the present value of the defined 
benefit obligation are based on actuarial valuation 
using the projected unit credit method. An actuarial 
valuation involves making various assumptions 
that may differ from actual developments in 
the future. These include the determination of 
the discount rate, future salary increases and 
mortality rates. Due to the complexities involved 
in the valuation and its long term nature, a defined 
benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes on 
those assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed 
at each reporting date.

**(h)	 Impairment of assets**

	
	
Investments 
in 
subsidiaries, 
goodwill 
and 

intangible assets are tested for impairment at 
least annually and when events occur or changes 

NOTES FORMING PART OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31ST MARCH, 2024 (Contd.)

----

Financial Statements

205

in circumstances indicate that the recoverable 
amount of the asset or cash generating units to 
which they pertain is less than its carrying value. 
The recoverable value of cash generating units 
is higher of value-in-use and fair value less cost 
to dispose. The calculation of value in use of a 
cash generating unit involves use of significant 
estimates and assumptions which includes 
turnover and earnings, multiples, growth rates 
and net margins used to calculate projected cash 
flows, risk adjusted discount rate, future economic 
and market conditions.

**4.3	  Significant accounting policies**

**(a)	 Transactions and balances**

	
	
Transactions in foreign currency are translated 
into Indian rupees at the exchange rates at the 
date of the transaction.

	
	
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in 
foreign currency are translated at the functional 
currency spot rates of exchange at the reporting 
date. Exchange differences arising on settlement 
or translation of monetary items are recognised in 
the statement of profit or loss.

	
	
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms 
of historical cost in foreign currency are translated 
using the exchange rates at the date of the initial 
transaction. Non-monetary items measured at fair 
value in a foreign currency are translated using the 
exchange rates at the date when the fair value is 
determined. The gain or loss arising on translation 
of non-monetary items measured at fair value is 
treated in line with the recognition of the gain or 
loss on the change in fair value of the item (i.e., 
translation difference on items whose fair value 
gain or loss is recognised in the statement of Other 
Comprehensive Income (OCI) or the statement of 
profit or loss is also recognised in the statement of 
OCI or the statement of profit or loss, respectively).

	
	
Application of accounting policies that require 
critical accounting estimates and the assumptions 
having the most significant effect on the amounts 
recognised in the standalone financial statements 
are:

	
	
Valuation of financial instruments

	
	
Useful life of property, plant and equipment

	
	
Useful life of intangible assets

	
	
Provisions

**(b)	 Current versus non-current classification**

	
	
The Group presents assets and liabilities in the 
balance sheet based on current/ non-current 
classification. An asset is treated as current when 
it is:

	
	
•	
Expected to be realised or intended to be sold 
or consumed in normal operating cycle

	
	
•	
Held primarily for trading

	
	
•	
Expected to be realised within twelve months 
after the reporting period, or

	
	
•	
Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted 
from being exchanged or used to settle a 
liability for at least twelve months after the 
reporting period.

	
	
•	
All other assets are classified as non-current.

	
	
A liability is current when

	
	
•	
It is expected to be settled in normal operating 
cycle

	
	
•	
It is held primarily for trading

	
	
•	
It is due to be settled within twelve months 
after the reporting period, or

	
	
•	
There is no unconditional right to defer the 
settlement of the liability for at least twelve 
months after the reporting period.

	
	
The Group classifies all other liabilities as non-
current.

	
	
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as 
non-current assets and liabilities

	
	
The operating cycle is the time between the 
acquisition of assets for processing and their 
realisation in cash and cash equivalents. The 
Group has identified twelve months as its 
operating cycle.

**(c)	 Fair value measurement**

	
	
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell 
an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly 
transaction between market participants at the 
measurement date. The fair value measurement 
is based on the presumption that the transaction 
to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place 
either:

	
	
In the principal market for the asset or liability, or

	
	
In the absence of a principal market, in the most 
advantageous market for the asset or liability

	
	
The principal or the most advantageous market 
must be accessible by the Group.

	
	
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured 
using the assumptions that market participants 

NOTES FORMING PART OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31ST MARCH, 2024 (Contd.)

----

would use when pricing the asset or liability, if 
market participants act in their economic best 
interest.

	
	
A fair value measurement of a non-financial 
asset considers a market participant’s ability to 
generate economic benefits by using the asset in 
its highest and best use or by selling it to another 
market participant that would use the asset in its 
highest and best use.

	
	
The Group uses valuation techniques that are 
appropriate in the circumstances and for which 
sufficient data are available to measure fair value, 
maximising the use of relevant observable inputs 
and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.

	
	
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is 
measured or disclosed in the standalone financial 
statements are categorised within the fair value 
hierarchy, described as follows, based on the 
lowest level input that is significant to the fair 
value measurement as a whole:

	
	
Level 1 - Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in 
active markets for identical assets or liabilities

	
	
Level 2- Valuation techniques for which the lowest 
level input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement is directly or indirectly observable

	
	
Level 3 -Valuation techniques for which the lowest 
level input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement is unobservable

	
	
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in 
consolidated financial statements on a recurring 
basis, the Group determines whether transfers 
have occurred between levels in the hierarchy 
by re-assessing categorisation (based on the 
lowest level input that is significant to the fair 
value measurement as a whole) at the end of each 
reporting period.

	
	
The Group’s Management determines the policies 
and procedures for both; recurring fair value 
measurement, such as derivative instruments 
and unquoted financial assets measured at fair 
value, and for non-recurring measurement, such 
as assets held for distribution in discontinued 
operations.

	
	
At each reporting date, the Management analyses 
the movements in the values of assets and 
liabilities which are required to be re-measured 
or re-assessed as per the Group’s accounting 
policies. For this analysis, the Management 
verifies the major inputs applied in the latest 
valuation by agreeing the information in the 

valuation computation to contracts and other 
relevant documents.

	
	
The Management also compares the change 
in the fair value of each asset and liability with 
relevant external sources to determine whether 
the change is reasonable. For 	the 
purpose 
of 

fair value disclosures, the Group has determined 
classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the 
nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or 
liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as 
explained above.

	
	
This note summarises accounting policy for fair 
value. Other fair value related disclosures are 
given in the relevant notes.

**(d)	  Property, plant and equipment**

	
	
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and where applicable 
accumulated impairment losses. Property, plant 
and equipment and capital work in progress cost 
include expenditure that is directly attributable 
to the acquisition of the asset. The cost of self-
constructed assets includes the cost of materials, 
direct labour and any other costs directly 
attributable to bringing the asset to a working 
condition for its intended use, and the costs of 
dismantling and removing the items and restoring 
the site on which they are located. Interest on 
Funds borrowed for acquisition of property, plant 
and equipment up to the period such property, 
plant and equipment is ready for use is capitalised 
and added to the cost of such items.

	
	
Gains and losses on disposal are determined by 
comparing the proceeds from disposal with the 
carrying amount of property, plant and equipment 
and are recognised net within “other income/other 
expenses” in the statement of profit and loss.

	
	
Depreciation in accounts is charged on Straight 
Line Method based on the management’s 
estimate of useful life of each class of assets and 
considering the useful life prescribed by Schedule 
II of the Companies Act, 2013 on the cost, as 
reduced by the amount of Excise Cenvat, GST and 
VAT setoff claimed.

	
	
Subsequent cost	

	
	
The cost of replacing part of an item of property, 
plant and equipment is recognised in the carrying 
amount of the item if it is probable that the future 
economic benefits embodied within the part will 
flow to the Group and its cost can be measured 
reliably. The costs of the day-to-day servicing of

reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted 
prospectively, if appropriate.

	
	
Amortisation is provided on Straight Line Method 
(SLM) basis, based on the estimated useful life of 
the assets.

**(e)	 Intangible assets**

	
	
Intangible assets acquired by the Group and 
having finite useful lives, are measured at cost 
less accumulated amortisation and accumulated 
impairment losses. Cost includes expenditure that 
is directly attributable to the acquisition of the 
intangible asset.

	
	
All revenue expenses pertaining to research are 
charged to the profit and loss account in the 
year in which they are incurred. Expenditure of 
capital nature is capitalised as property, plant and 
equipment and depreciated as per the Group’s 
policy.

Subsequent expenditure

	
	
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it 
increases the future economic benefits embodied 
in the specific asset to which it relates. All other 
expenditure, including expenditure on internally 
generated goodwill and brands, are recognised in 
profit or loss as incurred.

**Amortisation of intangible assets with finite 
useful lives:**

	
	
Amortisation is recognised in profit and loss on a 
straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives 
of intangible assets from the date that they are 
available for use.

**(f)	
Inventories**

	
	
Stock of raw materials, consumable stores and 
fuel and oil are valued at lower of cost or market 
value, on FIFO basis. Finished goods and work 
in progress are valued at cost of production or 
market value whichever is lower.

**(g)	 Earnings per share**

	
	
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing 
the profit / (loss) after tax (including the post-tax 
effect of extraordinary items, if any) by the weighted 
average number of equity shares outstanding 
during the year. Diluted earnings per share is 
computed by dividing the profit / (loss) after tax 
(including the post-tax effect of extraordinary 
items, if any) as adjusted for dividend, interest and 
other charges to expense or income relating to the 
dilutive potential equity shares, by the weighted 
average number of equity shares considered for 
deriving basic earnings per share and the weighted 
average number of equity shares which could 
have been issued on the conversion of all dilutive 
potential equity shares. Potential equity shares 
are deemed to be dilutive only if their conversion 
to equity shares would decrease the net profit 
per share from continuing ordinary operations. 
Potential dilutive equity shares are deemed to 
be converted as at the beginning of the period, 
unless they have been issued at a later date. The 
dilutive potential equity shares are adjusted for the 
proceeds receivable had the shares been actually 

NOTES FORMING PART OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31ST MARCH, 2024 (Contd.)

----

issued at fair value (i.e. average market value of 
the outstanding shares). Dilutive potential equity 
shares are determined independently for each 
period presented. The number of equity shares 
and potentially dilutive equity shares are adjusted 
for share splits / reverse share splits and bonus 
shares, as appropriate.

**(h)	 Borrowing costs**

	
	
Borrowing costs include interest, amortisation of 
ancillary costs incurred and exchange differences 
arising from foreign currency borrowings to the 
extent they are regarded as an adjustment to the 
interest cost. Borrowing cost directly attributable 
to the cost of acquisition or construction of the 
fixed assets is capitalised as part of the cost of the 
assets, upto the date the asset is put to use. Other 
borrowing costs are charged to the Statement 
of Profit and Loss in the year in which they are 
incurred Costs in connection with the borrowing of 
funds are charged to statement of profit and loss.

**(i)	
Provisions and contingent liabilities**

	
	
The Group recognises a provision when there is a 
present legal or constructive obligation as a result 
of a past events, it is probable that an outflow of 
resources will be required to settle the obligation 
and the amount can be reliably estimated.

	
	
Long term provisions are measured at the 
present value of management’s best estimate 
of the expenditure required to settle the present 
obligation at the end of the reporting period. 
The discount rate used to determine the present 
value is a pre-tax rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the 
risks specific to the liability. The increase in the 
provision due to the passage of time is recognised 
as interest expense.

	
	
A disclosure for a contingent liability is made 
when there is a possible obligation or a present 
obligation that may, but probably will not, require 
an outflow of resources. Where there is a possible 
obligation or a present obligation that the likelihood 
of outflow of resources is remote, no provision or 
disclosure is made.

**(j)	
Impairment of non-financial assets**

	
	
The Group assesses, at each reporting date, 
whether there is an indication that an asset may 
be impaired. If any indication exists, or when 
annual impairment testing for an asset is required, 
the Group estimates the asset’s recoverable 
amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the 

higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s 
(CGU) fair value less costs of disposal and its 
value in use. Recoverable amount is determined 
for an individual asset unless the asset does not 
generate cash inflows that are largely independent 
of those from other assets or Group’s assets. 
When the carrying amount of an asset or CGU 
exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is 
considered impaired and is written down to its 
recoverable amount.

**(k)	 Financial instruments**

	
	
A financial instrument is any contract that gives 
rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial 
liability or equity instrument of another entity.

**Financial asset**

**Initial recognition and measurement**

	
	
All financial assets are recognised initially at 
fair value plus, in the case of financial assets 
not recorded at fair value through profit or loss, 
transaction costs that are attributable to the 
acquisition of the financial asset. Purchase or sale 
of financial assets that require delivery of assets 
within a time frame established by regulation 
or convention in the market place (regular way 
trades) are recognised on the trade date, i.e., the 
date that the Group commits to purchase or sell 
the assets.

	
	
Investment in subsidiaries are carried at cost less 
impairment losses, if any. Where an indication 
of impairment exists, the carrying amount of 
the investment is assessed and written down 
immediately to its recoverable amount.

**Subsequent measurement**

	
	
For purposes of subsequent measurement, 
financial assets are classified in four categories;

	
	
at amortised cost through profit or loss

	
	
at amortised cost through other comprehensive 
income

	
	
at fair value through other comprehensive income

	
	
at fair value through profit or loss

**Financial assets at amortised cost**

	
	
A financial asset is measured at the amortised 
cost if both the following conditions are met:

	
	
The asset is held within a business model 
whose objective is to hold assets for collecting 
contractual cash flows, and

	
	
Contractual terms of the asset give rise on 
specified dates to cash flows that are solely

----

Financial Statements

payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the 
principal amount outstanding.

	
	
This category is the most relevant to the Group. 
All the Loans and other receivables under financial 
assets (except investments) are non-derivative 
financial assets with fixed or determinable 
payments that are not quoted in an active market. 
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and 
are stated at their nominal value as reduced by 
impairment amount.

	
	
After initial measurement, such financial assets 
are subsequently measured at amortised cost 
using the effective interest rate (EIR) method. 
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into 
account any discount or premium on acquisition 
and fees or costs that are an integral part of the 
EIR. The EIR amortisation is included in finance 
income in the statement of profit and loss. The 
losses arising from impairment are recognised 
in the statement of profit and loss. This category 
generally applies to trade and other receivables.

**Financial assets at fair value through the 
statement of profit and loss/other comprehensive 
income**

	
	
Instruments included within the FVTPL category 
are measured at fair value with all changes 
recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

	
	
If the Group decides to classify an instrument 
as at FVTOCI, then all fair value changes on the 
instrument, excluding dividends, are recognised in 
the statement of OCI. There is no recycling of the 
amounts from OCI to Statement of Profit & Loss, 
even on sale of investment. However, the Group 
may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within 
equity.

**De-recognition**

	
	
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part 
of a financial asset or part of a Group of similar 
financial assets) is primarily derecognised (i.e. 
removed from the Group’s balance sheet) when:

	
	
The rights to receive cash flows from the asset 
have expired, or

	
	
The Group has transferred its rights to receive 
cash flows from the asset or has assumed an 
obligation to pay the received cash flows in full 
without material lay to a third party under a ‘pass-
through’ arrangement; and either (a) the Group 
has transferred substantially all the risks and 
rewards of the asset, or (b) the Group has neither 
transferred nor retained substantially all the risks 

and rewards of the asset, but has transferred 
control of the asset.

	
	
When the Group has transferred its rights to 
receive cash flows from an asset or has entered 
into a pass-through arrangement, it evaluates 
if and to what extent it has retained the risks 
and rewards of ownership. When it has neither 
transferred nor retained substantially all of the 
risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred 
control of the asset, the Group continues to 
recognise the transferred asset to the extent of the 
Group’s continuing involvement. In that case, the 
Group also recognises an associated liability. The 
transferred asset and the associated liability are 
measured on a basis that reflects the rights and 
obligations that the Group has retained.

**Impairment of financials assets**

	
	
The Management has evaluated the impairment 
provision requirement under IND AS 109 and 
has listed below major facts for trade and other 
receivables impairment provisioning:

	
	
The Group does not have any purchased or 
originated credit-impaired (POCI) financial assets, 
i.e., financial assets which are credit impaired on 
purchase/ origination.

	
	
Expected Credit Loss (ECL) impairment loss 
allowance (or reversal) recognised during the 
period is recognised as income/expense in the 
statement of profit and loss. This amount is 
reflected under the head ‘other expenses’ in the 
Statement of Profit & Loss. The balance sheet 
presentation for various financial instruments is 
described below:

	
	
Financial assets measured as at amortised cost 
and other contractual revenue receivables- ECL 
is presented as an allowance, i.e., as an integral 
part of the measurement of those assets in the 
balance sheet. The allowance reduces the net 
carrying amount. Until the asset meets write-off 
criteria, the Group does not reduce impairment 
allowance from the gross carrying amount.

	
	
Financial assets measured at FVTOCI- Since 
financial assets are already reflected at fair value, 
impairment allowance is not further reduced from 
its value. Rather, ECL amount is presented as 
‘accumulated impairment amount’ in the OCI.

	
	
Financial liabilities	 	

**Initial recognition and measurement**

	
	
Financial liabilities are classified, at initial 
recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value 

NOTES FORMING PART OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31ST MARCH, 2024 (Contd.)

----

through the statement of profit or loss, loans and 
borrowings, trade payables and other payables.

	
	
All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair 
value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and 
payables, net of directly attributable transaction 
costs.

	
	
The Group’s financial liabilities include trade and 
other payables, loans and borrowings including 
other payables.

**Subsequent measurement**

	
	
The measurement of financial liabilities depends 
on their classification, as described below:

**Loans and borrowings**

	
	
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans 
and borrowings are subsequently measured at 
amortised cost using the EIR method. Gains and 
losses are recognised in the statement of profit 
and loss when the liabilities are derecognised as 
well as through the EIR amortisation process.

	
	
Amortised cost is calculated by considering any 
discount or premium on acquisition and fees or 
costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR 
amortisation is included as finance costs in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss.

	
	
This category generally applies to interest-bearing 
loans and borrowings.

**De-recognition**

	
	
A financial liability is derecognised when the 
obligation under the liability is discharged, 
cancelled or it expires. When an existing financial 
liability is replaced by another from the same 
lender on substantially different terms, or the terms 
of an existing liability are substantially modified, 
such an exchange or modification is treated as 
the de-recognition of the original liability and the 
recognition of a new liability. The difference in the 
respective carrying amounts is recognised in the 
statement of profit and loss.

**Offsetting of financial instruments**

	
	
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset 
and the net amount is reported in the balance 
sheet if there is a currently enforceable legal right 
to offset the recognised amounts and there is an 
intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the 
assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.

**(l)	
Cash and cash equivalents**

	
	
For presentation in the statement of cash flows, 
cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand, 
deposits held at call with financial institutions, 

other short-term, highly liquid investments with 
original maturities of three months or less that 
are readily convertible to known amounts of cash 
and which are subject to an insignificant risk 
of changes in value. Bank overdrafts and cash 
credits are shown within borrowings in current 
liabilities in the balance sheet.

**(m)	 Employee benefits**

**Defined contribution plans (Provident Fund)**

	
	
In accordance with Indian Law, eligible employees 
receive benefits from Provident Fund, which is 
defined contribution plan. Both the employee 
and employer make monthly contributions to the 
plan, which is administrated by the Government 
authorities, each equal to the specific percentage 
of employee’s basic salary. The Group has no 
further obligation under the plan beyond its 
monthly contributions. Obligation for contributions 
to the plan is recognised as an employee benefit 
expense in the Statement of Profit and Loss when 
incurred.

**Defined benefit plans (Gratuity)**

	
	
In accordance with applicable Indian Law, the 
Group provides for gratuity, a defined benefit 
retirement plan (the Gratuity Plan) covering 
eligible employees. The Gratuity Plan provides 
a lump sum payment to vested employees, at 
retirement or termination of employment, and 
amount based on respective last drawn salary 
and the years of employment with the Group. The 
Group’s net obligation in respect of the Gratuity 
Plan is calculated by estimating the amount of 
future benefits that the employees have earned 
in return of their service in the current and prior 
periods; that benefit is discounted to determine its 
present value. Any unrecognised past service cost 
and the fair value of plan assets are deducted. The 
discount rate is the yield at reporting date on risk 
free government bonds that have maturity dates 
approximating the terms of the Group’s obligation. 
The calculation is performed annually by a 
qualified actuary using the projected unit credit 
method. When the calculation results in a benefit 
to the Group, the recognised asset is limited to 
the total of any unrecognised past service cost 
and the present value of the economic benefits 
available in the form of any future refunds from 
the plan or reduction in future contribution to the 
plan. The Group recognises all re-measurements 
of net defined benefit liability/asset directly in 
other comprehensive income.

**Compensated absences**

	
	
The employees of the Group are entitled to 
compensated absences. The employees can 
carry forward a portion of the unutilised accrued 
absence and utilise it in future periods or receive 
cash compensation at retirement or termination 
of employment for the unutilised accrued 
compensated absence. The Group recognises 
an obligation for compensated absences in 
the period in which the employee renders the 
services. The Group provides for the expected 
cost of compensated absence in the statement of 
profit and loss as the additional amount that the 
Group expects to pay as a result of the unused 
entitlement that has accumulated based on 
actuarial valuations carried out by an independent 
actuary at the balance sheet date.

**(n)	 Segment reporting**

	
	
The Group has presented data relating to its 
segments based on its consolidated financial 
statements which are presented in the same 
Integrated Annual Report. Accordingly, in terms 
of paragraph 4 of the Indian Accounting Standard 
(Ind AS 108) “Operating Segments” the Group has 
only one reportable primary business segment 
- namely Pharmaceuticals. However, the Group 
has a secondary geographical segment which is 
disclosed in consolidated financial statements as 
per Ind AS 108.

**(o)	 Leases**

	
	
A lease that transfers substantially all the risks 
and rewards incidental to ownership to the lessee 
is classified as a finance lease. All other leases are 
classified as operating leases.

**Group as a lessee**

	
	
Finance leases are capitalised at the commencement 
of the lease at the inception date fair value of the 
leased property or, if lower, at the present value of 
the minimum lease payments. The corresponding 
liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet 
as a finance lease obligation. Lease payments are 
apportioned between finance charges and reduction 
of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate 
of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. 
Finance charges are recognised in profit or loss as 
finance costs, unless they are directly attributable to 
qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalised 
in accordance with the Group’s general policy on the 
borrowing costs. Contingent rentals are recognised 
as expenses in the periods in which they are incurred.

	
	
Operating 
lease 
payments 
are 
generally 

recognised as an expense in the profit or loss on 
a straight-line basis over the lease term. Where 
the rentals are structured solely to increase in line 
with expected general inflation to compensate for 
the lessor’s expected inflationary cost increases, 
such increases are recognised in the year in which 
such benefits accrue.

**Ind AS 116 Leases:**

	
	
In March 2019, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, 
issued 
the 
Companies 
(Indian 
Accounting 

Standards) Amendment Rules 2018, notifying 
Ind AS 116 “Leases” which replaces Ind AS 17 
“Leases”. The new standard shall require lessees to 
recognise the Leases on their Balance Sheet with 
limited exemptions related to low value asset and 
assets with a lease term of less than 12 months.

	
	
Lessees will use a single accounting model for 
all leases. Accordingly, the lessee is required to 
recognise “Right of Use” asset representing its 
right to use the underlying asset and a “Lease 
Liability” representing its obligations to make 
lease payments.

**(p)	 Government Grants**

	
	
Government grants are initially recognised at fair 
value if there is reasonable assurance that they 
will be received and the Group will comply with the 
conditions associated with the grant;

	
	
In case of capital grants, the amount of grant 
received is set off against the value of the property, 
plant and equipment against which the grant has 
been given.

	
	
In case of grants that compensate the Group for 
expenses incurred are recognised in Statement 
of Profit and Loss on a systematic basis in the 
periods in which the expenses are recognised.

	
	
Export benefits available under prevalent schemes 
are accrued in the year in which the goods are 
exported and there is no uncertainty in receiving 
the same.

**(q)	 Recent accounting pronouncements**

	
	
Ministry 
of 
Corporate 
Affairs 
(“MCA”) 

notifies 
new 
standards 
or 
amendments 

to 
the 
existing 
standards 
under


Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 
as issued from time to time. For the year ended 
31st March, 2024, MCA has not notified any 
new standards or amendments to the existing 
standards applicable to the Group.

**37. FAIR VALUES**

Fair value measurement includes both the significant financial instruments stated at amortised cost and at fair value in the 
statement of financial position. The carrying values of current financial instruments approximate their fair values due to the 
short-term maturity of these instruments and the disclosures of fair value are not made when the carrying amount of current 
financial instruments is a reasonable approximation of the fair value. The carrying values of the long-term financial instruments 
approximates the fair values as the management has considered the fair value measurement techniques using the observable 
data i.e. the discounting rate which was similar as to rates, tenure and the credit rating of the other instruments of the Group. 
The management has also considered the effect of time value of money with respect to other long term financial instruments 
at applicables rates.	

**38. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES**

The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk,credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s risk 
management assessment and policies and processes are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to 
set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor such risks and compliance with the same.

The Group has constituted a Risk Management Committee consisting of its directors. The Group has a robust risk management 
policy to identify, evaluate business risks and opportunities. This policy seeks to create transparency, minimise adverse impact 
on the business objectives and enhance the Group’s competitive advantage.

**Carrying amount of financial assets and liabilities:**

**39. CREDIT RISK**

Credit risk arises from the possibility that customers shall not be able to settle their obligations as agreed and arises principally 
from the Group’s receivables from customers, loans and investments. Credit risk is managed through credit approvals, 
establishing credit limits and continuously monitoring the creditworthiness of counterparty to which the Group grants credit 
terms in the normal course of business.	

**Investments**

The Group limits its exposure to credit risk by investing in liquid securities which primarily include mutual fund units. The Group 
mitigates risk from non-performance of these securities by ensuring that it does not have any significant concentration of 
exposures to specific industry sectors or specific country risks.

**Trade receivables**

Trade receivables are typically unsecured and derived from revenue earned from customers. On account of adoption of Ind AS 
109, the Group uses expected credit loss model to assess the impairment loss or gain, however this is modified if in the past 
experience of the Group, there is likely mitigation of the credit risk.

**40. MARKET RISK**

Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in 
market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk, such as equity 
price risk and commodity risk. The value of a financial instrument shall change as a result of changes in the interest rates, 
foreign currency exchange rates, equity price fluctuations, liquidity and other market changes. Financial instruments affected 
by market risk include loans and borrowings, deposits and investments. 	

**41. FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK**

Foreign exchange risk arises on future commercial transactions and on all recognised monetary assets and liabilities, which are 
denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the Group. The Group’s management has set policy wherein 
exposure is identified, benchmark is set and monitored closely, and accordingly suitable hedges are undertaken. The Group’s 
foreign currency exposure arises mainly from foreign exchange imports and exports, primarily with respect to US$, JPY and 
EUR.

**43. LIQUIDITY RISK**

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they become due. The objective of 
liquidity risk management is to maintain sufficient liquidity and ensure that funds are available for use as per requirements.

The Group manages the liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities, by 
continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows, and by matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities. 
The Group invests its surplus funds in bank fixed deposits and liquid schemes of mutual funds which carry limited mark to 
market risks. The Group also invests in equity schemes of mutual funds which carry liquidity and rate return risks.

At present, the Group expects to repay all liabilities at their contractual maturity. In order to meet such cash commitments, the 
operating activity is expected to generate sufficient cash inflows.

**44. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT**

For the purpose of the Group’s capital management, capital includes issued equity capital, share premium and all other equity 
reserves attributable to the equity holders of the Group. The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to maximise 
the value of shareholder.

The Group monitors capital using Capital Gearing Ratio, which is net debt divided by total capital. Net debt includes loans and 
borrowings, trade and other payables, less cash and cash equivalents.

To achieve the overall objective, the Group’s capital management aims to ensure that it meets the financial covenants attached 
to loans and borrowings. Breaches in meeting the covenants would permit the bank to immediately call loans and borrowings. 
There have been no breaches in the financial covenants of any loans and borrowings in the current year.
