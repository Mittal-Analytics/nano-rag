**What operational updates would you 
like to highlight?**

Our commitment to providing value-driven solutions 
to our clients has been a key factor in our success. 
By prioritising the consistent delivery of high-quality 
products, we have expanded our collaborations 
and strengthened our market presence. A 
significant aspect of our operations is our focus 
on R&D, particularly in complex multi-step organic 
synthesis for the manufacture of generic APIs and 
intermediates. This has enabled us to maintain a 
diversified product portfolio, avoiding excessive 
reliance on any single product, customer, or 
geography, which has been the cornerstone of our 
resilience.

We are significantly enhancing our production 
capacities by commissioning new plants and 
pharmaceutical-grade clean rooms. This vertically 
integrated approach, combined with the global shift 
to the China+1 supply strategy, is likely to help shift 
the base to India, benefiting players like us in the 
animal healthcare industry. Ongoing construction 
at our Tarapur facility is pivotal in expanding our 
manufacturing capabilities. This increase in capacity, 
along with our innovative product portfolio, positions 
us well to meet the rising demand for animal 
healthcare products.

If the demand recovery continues positively, we may 
explore outsourcing some fine manufacturing to 
capitalise on growth opportunities. The recovery we 
have seen is encouraging, and if it remains strong, we 
may outsource manufacturing until our new facility 
becomes operational. Our CAPEX plan is progressing 
well and remains on track, with the first phase 
expected to be completed by the end of FY 2024-25. 
Our focus will be on gaining market share and growing 
our business while maintaining financial prudence 
and sustainability.

**How is the Company handling the 
regulatory challenges in international 
markets?**

Navigating regulatory challenges, particularly in 
markets like the US and Europe, is a critical focus 
for us due to the varied regulations across regions. 
In the US, the process involves preparing the plant, 
producing validation batches, filing necessary 
documentation, and undergoing an inspection, which 
typically takes 2-3 years. The European market, 
however, allows for a more expedited process. 
Through strategic planning and execution, we ensure 
compliance with all regulatory requirements, thereby 
facilitating our entry and growth in these vital 
markets.

**In an ever-evolving global market, 
adaptability and innovation 
are paramount. NGL Fine-
Chem Limited exemplifies 
these principles, consistently 
demonstrating resilience and 
forward-thinking strategies. 
The theme for this year, ‘Grow. 
Expand. Thrive.’, encapsulates 
NGL’s commitment to continuous 
improvement and robust growth.**

**GROW. 
EXPAND. 
THRIVE.**

**As NGL looks to the future, ‘Grow. Expand. 
Thrive.’ is more than a theme, it is a vision. 
It embodies NGL’s dedication to advancing 
the industry, supporting customers, and 
achieving unparalleled growth.**

NGL has consistently exceeded expectations, achieving 
remarkable growth across all parameters. Driven by 
increasing volumes across its diverse product portfolio, 
from veterinary APIs to human APIs, intermediates, and 
finished dosage forms, the Company’s growth trajectory has 
been nothing short of impressive. By delivering high-quality 
products and expanding collaborations, it enhances its 
market presence. Strategic investments in R&D, particularly 
in complex multi-step organic synthesis, continues to 
strengthen the Company’s product portfolio, meeting 
demand and introducing groundbreaking products.

**GROW**

With state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities and a significant 
presence in over 51 countries, NGL is strategically positioned 
to capture new markets and expand its global footprint. The 
ongoing greenfield expansion at Tarapur, with an estimated 
capex of ` 160 Crore, underscores its ambitious vision for the 
future. This expansion not only increases capacity but also 
creates new possibilities, driving the next phase of exponential 
growth. The Company is enhancing its production capacities. 
With its vertically integrated approach, supported by the global 
shift to the China+1 supply strategy, the Company is well-
positioned to meet the rising demand for animal healthcare 
products and expand its geographical reach.

**EXPAND**

In an industry where excellence is the baseline, NGL has 
consistently raised the bar with majority of in-house 
production, ensuring unparalleled cost competitiveness and 
quality. Zero product rejections in 15 years amply highlights 
its commitment to innovation. By prioritising sustainability 
and inclusive growth, and focussing on operational 
efficiency, the Company is aiming to ensure long-term 
profitability and resilience.
